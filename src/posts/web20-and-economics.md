I’m bored… I’m working pretty hard at [Sabretech](http://www.sabretechllc.com), trying to bring home the bacon, but it is just not enough…

I’ve been spending every extra free time moment reading up on and studying this web trend called web 2.0… What is it about, you ask? Mr. O’Reilly [gets it right](http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/2005/10/web_20_compact_definition.html), I think…

So, I really want to contribute somehow, but I’m a nobody in the web 2.0 world, and honestly haven’t had many groundbreaking ideas in a long time (if ever)… But I will not be deterred, so I’ve decided to start thinking about web 2.0 from an economic standpoint, since that was my focus in college…

That said, don’t come back here looking for amazing insights or anything. Maybe—just maybe—though, I’ll have an epiphany and “make it” in the web 2.0 movement :-)
