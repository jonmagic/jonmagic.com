Actually, my business bought one for me, but still… What am I talking about?

**I bought a [Macbook](http://www.apple.com/macbook/) this afternoon!**

Ok, so I don’t have it yet (hopefully Monday) but I have been looking at Macbook pictures and have been reading about it as much as possible (including a firsthand report from xian)… So here are some links you can check out if you are interested…
