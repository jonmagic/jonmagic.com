If you are using a [Rhino Equipment card](http://www.rhinoequipment.com/) as your PSTN or digital interface to the telco, and need help setting it up on your Asterisk-based PBX, look no further!

[This google doc](http://docs.google.com/View?id=atnp7jn5zpr_95fn6n8bc6) has just the instructions you need. (Thanks to James at Rhino for these great instructions!)

Also, as far as telco cards go, I couldn’t recommend anyone better than [Rhino](http://www.rhinoequipment.com/). Their cards are great, and their technical support is the best I’ve ever had from any company, EVER. They are, simply put, amazing at what they do.

Oh yeah, when it comes to open source PBX platforms, [PBX in a Flash](http://www.pbxinaflash.com/) is the best I’ve found. I’ve tried Asterisk@Home, Trixbox, and a couple others. PiaF is easy to set up, clean, and simple.
