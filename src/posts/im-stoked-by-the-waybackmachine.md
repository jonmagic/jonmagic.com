Man, I was just thinking the other day about all the content I’ve lost over the years switching blogging platforms. Then I listened to a podcast (most likely from Leo Laporte’s [TWIT](http://twit.tv) network) and found out about the [WayBackMachine](http://archive.org) on archive.org… I know I’ve heard of it before but always thought “what is that good for anyway???”

Well today I checked it out, and all [my blog posts from 2004 and 2005](http://web.archive.org/web/*/http://jonmagic.com) are on there :-)
There are tons of other sites I’ve lost, most of which I probably won’t ever find not because the way back machine doesn’t have them, but because I can’t remember the URLs…

Anyways, it was just fun reading some of the stuff I wrote a few years ago. I actually sounded smarter back then :-P
