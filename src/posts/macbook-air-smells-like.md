  MacBook Air's design is sleek, but what’s up with the return to IDE tech?
  Thought we were all-in on SATA. Guess I'm holding out for the MacBook Pro.

Nah, I know, [it's pretty](http://www.apple.com/macbookair/). But has anyone else noticed that they are switching back to [IDE](http://forums.macrumors.com/showthread.php?p=4762051)? I thought that everything was going to SATA. I guess after reading up that it doesn’t make much difference, but, whatever.

Ok, so I’m upset because I wanted a new laptop, and they didn’t come out with one I want. Guess I’ll have to wait for the MacBook Pro updates.
