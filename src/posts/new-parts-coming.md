Ok, I broke down and purchased the next couple of upgrades for my gaming PC… The first is actually one I linked to on the last gaming pc rig post, the **PNY Geforce 9600 GT with 512mb**… The second is this [little puppy](http://tinyurl.com/2n767u), so I don’t run out of juice :-) I’ll post how things work once my parts arrive!
