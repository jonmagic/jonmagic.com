  Warm days bring joy: wore sandals, walked the dogs, and braved first solo
  baths. Winter might return, but for now, relishing every sunny moment!

I know it's not really spring yet, but I can’t help but get my hopes up.
Today around noon we reached 41 degrees, the sun was out, and it just felt amazing outside.

To celebrate I cleaned out my car :-)

Then at 3pm we took the dogs for a walk—only Bailey’s second walk, and his first to the park. When we got home, Natalie gave Bailey a bath in the sink while I gave Leo a bath in the tub (first time doing each of them alone; quite a trick). Now I’m grilling outside, with sandals on!

I’m sure next week the temperature will be back down in the teens, but I can’t help but get excited.
