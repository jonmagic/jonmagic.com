  Reflecting on a year of gratitude: a new marriage, business milestones,
  travels, and family joys. Even small wins, like a new laptop, bring big
  smiles!

What a great year! Here are some of the things I thank God for everyday:

1. I’m [getting married!](http://jonmagic.com/2006/8/4/i-m-engaged)
2. Brad Cochran and I bought [SabreTech Consulting LLC](http://www.sabretechllc.com) just over a year and a half ago, and it is just about paid off…
3. Good health the last 6 months (with the exception of today), I even had my wisdom teeth removed (finally!)
4. I’ve had the opportunity to travel, a lot
5. [New laptop](http://jonmagic.com/2006/5/16/i-bought-one)
6. New (used) car… 98 Malibu
7. Healthy family! My sis is back from school now too, and that is always nice…

I had other ones, but just can’t remember them all right now… I’m sick and need to take a nap so I can get better, so I’m going to lie down now…
