  Popped the question on our 4th anniversary and Natalie said yes! Totally surprised her and it was epic. Here's to forever together!

Wednesday, August 2nd, 2006 I asked Natalie Burke to marry me and she said yes… It was our 4 year anniversary (since we started dating) and I’m sure she’s been waiting awhile for me to ask, but I got her completely by surprise (it was awesome!!!)…
