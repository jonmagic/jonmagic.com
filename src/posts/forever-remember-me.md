So I’ve finished my first big programming project, [Forever Remember Me](http://www.foreverrememberme.com), a website catering to the families and friends of those who have passed away… It is essentially a place for these families to create a memorial, and upload pictures, leave comments, and leave tributes (donations, which can go to a charity)… So, make sure and check it out…
