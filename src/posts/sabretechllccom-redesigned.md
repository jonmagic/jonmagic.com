Wow, in preparation for our open house this weekend we have been on a mad spree: remodeling the office, making line cards, new business cards, gift certificates, new tables and chairs, **AND** a [NEW WEBSiTE](http://sabretechllc.com)!!!

[Christian Metts](http://mintchaos.com) took some ideas I had and a bunch of good ideas he had and threw together a layout with images in Photoshop in just a few hours. He sent me 4 images: a header, navbar background, navbar divider, a couple hex codes, and an image with the overall look and feel he wanted…

I took everything he sent and threw it together into a fairly comparable real page using HTML, CSS, and images, all on top of [mephisto](http://mephistoblog.com). It took me about 4 hours, and then another 30 min of Christian showing me how to tweak stuff, and I have a gorgeous site that works in 6 browsers (that's how many I’ve tested so far). Check out the [before](http://jonmagic.com/assets/2007/7/13/before.png), [mockup](http://jonmagic.com/assets/2007/7/13/mockup.png), and [after](http://sabretechllc.com) pictures…
