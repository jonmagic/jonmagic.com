  Follow my journey of crafting a custom Twitter client for Windows, inspired by
  Tweetie! Dive into the app's evolution with Ruby and Shoes.

One of my clients wants his employees to be able to use Twitter, but there were some strict requirements involved, and I couldn’t find a Twitter client for Windows that met all of those requirements, so I decided to write my own Twitter client.

I’m modeling it after Tweetie for OSX, of course (in look and function). I know Ruby best, so I decided to use [\_why’s](http://whytheluckystiff.net/) [Shoes](http://shoooes.net/) and [John Nunemaker’s](http://railstips.org) [twitter gem](http://github.com/jnunemaker/twitter/tree/master).

For those interested in writing a Twitter client and using Shoes, or who like to see the evolution of an app, be sure to check out this article.

This article is going to be updated as I write this app, but I just wanted to start with a slideshow of the evolution of the app so far.
