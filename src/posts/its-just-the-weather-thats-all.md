  Enjoying the storms while building "Optiks", a sleek alternative trouble ticket system for Sabretech with minimalism and 37 Signals magic.

Good morning…

Isn’t this great weather we’ve been having! Temps have been in the 50’s and 60’s, thunderstorms have been rolling through… I love a good storm.

So I’m wrapping up a big programming project, just doing the final touches here and there, addressing the customers final concerns, and I’ve already started my next project. Sabretech is in dire need of a trouble ticket system better than the one we’re using… We currently use the ticket system module in [egroupware](http://www.egroupware.org), as well as the egroupware calendar module. I can say we are less than thrilled with our current situation… So I’ve started this new project and called it Optiks, short for Opportunity Tickets. As you can see, the first thing we’re dropping is the Trouble part :-) Dad suggested this, hehe… I’m designing and building this with [37 Signals](http://37signals.com/) methodology in mind… Some people would like it to have everything and the kitchen sink… I’m mostly just interested in it doing a few simple things really well, with a nice API and the ability to expand and change it later on… So that is what I’m doing!

Also, looks like I’ll be jamming with Roll the Dice this coming Friday night… I played in church this morning, and then practiced this afternoon with RtD… We didn’t sound too bad i guess :-)

Good Night…
