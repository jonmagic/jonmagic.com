I know, I know, that's not a big deal considering I’m part owner in a computer store. But it IS a big deal to me, cuz this computer is going to be my tech/gaming machine for my house. Here is the spec list:

- [Asus P5W DH Deluxe](http://www.newegg.com/product/product.aspx?item=N82E16813131025)
- Intel Core 2 Duo 2.2GHz with 2MB of L2 cache
- 2GB of DDR2 667MHz memory
- 80GB 7200rpm HDD
- plain old black computer case
- Lite-On 16x DVD-burner
- **MOST IMPORTANT**: [Nvidia 9600GT video card](http://www.xpcgear.com/gig9600gt.html)
- "Acer 19\[LCD monitor\](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16824009091)
- best keyboard I can find lying around
- [Logitech MX-518 gaming mouse](http://www.bestbuy.com/site/olspage.jsp?skuId=7105919&st=logitech+gaming&lp=4&type=product&cp=1&id=1109233585993)

I’ll also either be setting up some nice speakers, or get a nice little USB headset for talking in my games :-) Fun fun…

Did I mention I’m stoked?
