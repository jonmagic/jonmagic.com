Thanks to [Daniel](http://behindlogic.com) for creating a [nifty new jquery](http://github.com/dcparker/jquery_plugins/tree/master/quickselect) plugin for me! [Quickselect](http://github.com/dcparker/jquery_plugins/tree/master/quickselect) takes select/option tags in HTML and turns them into an input box with live search, and can even use the [quicksilver.js](http://rails-oceania.googlecode.com/svn/lachiecox/qs_score/trunk/qs_score.js) for more interesting search results.

I needed this for Suite, the software I’m writing to manage my company [SabreTech](http://www.sabretechllc.com), and I could not for the life of me find a jQuery plugin that did something nifty like this. I had found this [autocomplete](http://www.pengoworks.com/workshop/jquery/autocomplete.htm) plugin, and [this live search](http://ejohn.org/blog/jquery-livesearch/) plugin (which was actually a rewrite of another plugin by a friend of mine, [John Nunemaker](http://orderedlist.com/articles/live-search-with-quicksilver-style-for-jquery))…

So I asked Dan to write this up for us yesterday, and this afternoon he found some time and put it together, and guess what, it works **PERFECTLY**!

Well, I hope others find this useful…
