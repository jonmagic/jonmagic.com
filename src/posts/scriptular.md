  Test JavaScript regex easily with Scriptular! No backend needed; everything
  runs in your browser. Perfect for developers seeking a simple testing tool.
---

Ever since [Hubot](http://hubot.github.com) was released I’ve been regular expressing myself. Here is a tool I built to make testing regular expressions in JavaScript easier.

[Rubular](http://rubular.com) was my go-to for testing regex in the past, but it's targeted at Ruby so I went in search of a nice editor for JavaScript regular expressions. Unfortunately my search yielded no results. Fortunately I had the tools and experience to build one!

[Scriptular](http://scriptular.com) is the fruit of my labor. I modeled Scriptular after Rubular with one major difference: it doesn’t have a backend service—everything runs in the browser.

I am really excited about Scriptular; I think it will be useful for developers everywhere. With its current implementation, you can test how a regex reacts in any browser by loading Scriptular in that browser and testing the regex. In the future, I would also like to have a backend service for testing server-side JavaScript implementations like V8.

So go [kick the tires](http://scriptular.com), give it a [spin around the block](http://scriptular.com), and let me know what you think. If you would like to help on the project, please [check it out on GitHub](http://github.com/jonmagic/scriptular).

Update: Thanks to [@bkeepers](http://opensoul.org) for contributing the design.
