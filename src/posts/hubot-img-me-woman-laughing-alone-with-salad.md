  Join a journey from London to Verona sharing the magic of Hubot—an open-source
  robot that’s sparking creativity and laughter in the tech world!
---

In the past month I’ve had the opportunity to present this talk twice, first in London England and then in Verona Italy.

Before joining GitHub I met [Zach Holman](http://zachholman.com/) from GitHub at a conference in Colorado and heard about [Hubot](http://hubot.github.com). As soon as Hubot was released as open source we started using him at Ordered List and I blogged a simple [script writing tutorial](http://theprogrammingbutler.com/blog/archives/2011/10/28/hubot-scripts-explained/), which is still my most popular blog post day to day.

After joining GitHub I got up the nerve to write and submit a talk proposal and lo and behold two out of three of the conferences I submitted to accepted my talk. I gave this presentation first in London at [DevsLoveBacon](http://devslovebacon.com/) and you can find the [video of my talk](http://devslovebacon.com/speakers/jonathan-hoyt) on their site. A few weeks later I traveled to [jsDay in Verona Italy](http://2012.jsday.it/) and presented a second time!

Here are the slides from my presentation.

If you have any feedback on how I can make the talk better or any questions about Hubot please send it via [Twitter @jonmagic](http://twitter.com/jonmagic).
