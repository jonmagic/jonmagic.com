---

# Hi, my name is Jon and I'm a husband, father, software developer, and investor.

I have over two decades of experience building businesses, products, and teams. I love to learn, iterate, and fail fast on the path to success. I strive to lead with a servantâ€™s heart and improve the lives of those around me.

I am open to new consulting opportunities and advisory roles so reach out if you are looking for someone to help with:

- applying AI and ML to solve real business problems
- improving development processes and shipping velocity
- product or project planning
- scaling applications to serve hundreds of thousands or millions of customers

Thank you for your time.
