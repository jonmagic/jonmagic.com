      <p>This is a post from my old blog that Iâ€™ve put up for solidarity. To this day I still get emails from people inquiring about this model slicer ðŸ˜ƒ</p>
<p>About a year before my parents headed to South America they started getting rid of most of the stuff theyâ€™d accumulated over the years. One of the last things they gifted to Natalie and I was a meat slicer that looked pretty beat up and rusty, but had promise for anyone willing to take the time to take it apart and restore it.</p>
<p>Itâ€™s been sitting in my garage for several months now, collecting dust and more rust. But last weekend, as part of my meat smoking tradition (started about 6 weeks ago, see older posts for fun smoking adventures), I decided I wanted to thinly slice the meat I smoked, and Iâ€™m not very good at thinly slicing meat with a knife, so I needed something more.</p>
<p>I dug the meat slicer out of the corner of the garage, carried it inside (without putting out my back!) and got to work.</p>
<p>I started by taking it apart, a bit of a challenge the first time, but Iâ€™m sure it will be easier in the future now that I know what Iâ€™m doing.</p>
<p>Here are all the individual parts laid out on my counter ready to go into the dishwasher. Oh yeah, I also used a toothbrush and baking soda to scrub the rusty spots and remove about 90% of the rust.</p>
<p>While the parts were in the dishwasher I started researching this slicer. A Globe Gravity Feed Slicer, Model #150, Serial #223739.</p>
<p>Couldnâ€™t find much on the internet, other than <a href="http://www.globeslicers.com/site/default.asp">Globeâ€™s Website</a>, and that they are located in Dayton Ohio. They did have contact info on their website though, so I shot them an email asking if they could tell me more about my slicer, and if they had any manuals or accessories for this thing lying around in a warehouse.</p>
<p>When the parts were done in the dishwasher I put it back together and my did it look good!</p>
<p>I used it to slice my smoked beef shoulder roast that night (thatâ€™s a whole other story, 14 hours on the smoker + 2 hours in the oven crazy) and also sliced some cheese, onion, and bread. It works beautifully, really quite cool. The only problem now is figuring out where to put it ðŸ˜ƒ</p>
<p>One last thing: Globe did email me the following Monday, and explained that the current owners bought Globe in 1993, and did not have anything from this old model slicer around. They did tell me though that it was manufactured in 1949.</p>
