      <h1 class="site-title">Sleep Apnea Survivor</h1>
      <p>Almost two years ago a friend and my wife saved my life. They got me to go see a doctor because my sleep was a mix of bone rattling snores, deathly silence, and gasps for air. If this sounds like someone you know, help save a life.</p>
<h3>I should have listened to her</h3>
<p>She wouldn’t say “I told you so” but I am certainly guilty of not following my wife’s advice several years ago to go see a doctor because I snored so loudly.</p>
<p>I should have had more empathy for her situation, struggling to get sleep next to a roaring locomotive. Some nights she would go sleep in another room so she could be rested enough in the morning to go to work.</p>
<h3>Resorting to the bathtub</h3>
<p>Then there was a night in Lansing Michigan where I shared a hotel room with three friends while attending a tech conference. In the morning I found one of them sleeping in the bathtub, another with headphones on, and the other with his head wrapped tightly in a pillow.</p>
<p>When they woke up they were exhausted, trying to laugh it off in order to resist the urge to kill me (something discussed during the night). They described my sleep as snores loud enough to shake both beds in the room, interspersed with moments of sweet blissful silence,</p>
