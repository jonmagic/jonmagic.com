      <h1 class="site-title">Farewell RailsConf and Thank You For Everything</h1>
      <p>My career as a professional software developer started nearly two decades ago, though it truly took root at the first RailsConf in Chicago in 2006. My consultancy was <a href="https://jonmagic.com/posts/learning-rails/">already using Rails</a>, but RailsConf gave me a glimpse of something even more exciting, a community of developers. Christian Metts (who introduced me Rails) and I noticed nearly everyone at the conference had MacBooks, even us, while only about fifty attendees didn’t. We decided to honor those “non‑MacBook” folks with tongue‑in‑cheek <strong>Certificates of Nonconformity</strong>, signed (jokingly) by Bill Gates and Linus Torvalds, and <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/mintchaos/albums/72157594176520552/">snapped pics</a>, including one of <em>why the lucky stiff</em>.</p>
<p><img src="/images/posts/farewell-railsconf-and-thank-you-for-everything/why-the-lucky-stiff.webp" alt="why the lucky stiff holding a certificate of nonconformity"></p>
<p>That playful moment, the community, and the shared curiosity, set the tone for everything that followed.</p>
<h2>From Meetup to Speaker Deck</h2>
<p>Shortly after RailsConf, I attended a Ruby meetup at Notre Dame and met <a href="https://johnnunemaker.com">John Nunemaker</a> and <a href="https://orderedlist.com">Steve Smith</a>. One afternoon over a few beers at Fiddler’s in South Bend Indiana they started griping about SlideShare after trying to upload slides from a recent conference one of them had spoken at. So I pulled up my terminal, installed ImageMagick, and started hacking a PDF‑to‑image converter for slides. <a href="https://jonmagic.com/posts/the-history-of-speaker-deck/">That quick hack at the bar turned into a years long collaboration</a> on <a href="https://speakerdeck.com">Speaker Deck</a> and later my <a href="https://jonmagic.com/posts/grim/">first Rubygem called Grim</a>.</p>
<h2>Joining OrderedList &amp; Building a Business on Rails</h2>
<p>In December 2010 I became Ordered List’s first full‑time developer, joining Steve and John, and later <a href="https://opensoul.org/">Brandon Keepers</a> and <a href="https://madebygraham.com/">Matt Graham</a>. We kept building their first product HarmonyApp, Speaker Deck, and launched <a href="http://Gaug.es">Gaug.es</a>, a Rails‑based analytics tool because we disliked using Google Analytics so much, all while consulting on larger projects like Words With Friends to pay the bills.</p>
<p>Through meetups and conferences our team met the GitHub cofounders and employees like <a href="https://adaptivepatchwork.com/">Tim Clem</a> and <a href="https://zachholman.com/">Zach Holman</a> and in the fall of 2011 one of the cofounders reached out to John and Steve to see if we were interested in joining GitHub. What an amazing time and opportunity this was to be GitHub’s first acquisition/acquire.</p>
<p><img src="/images/posts/farewell-railsconf-and-thank-you-for-everything/orderedlist-joins-github.webp" alt="OrderedList joins GitHub"></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Side note 1: A year before GitHub was founded I exchanged emails with one of the cofounders Chris Wanstrath after he emailed me about a Rails consulting opportunity I had posted on a Ruby forum. I’d forgotten about this email exchange until 2013 and I’d been working for GitHub for nearly 2 years.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Side note 2: Brandon, John, and I were some of GitHub’s earliest users with ids #173, #235, and #623</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>A GitHub Career</h2>
<p>After our acquihire in late 2011, I worked my way through nearly every department at GitHub building our support software (a Rails app called Halp), then integrating our business software with the GitHub monolith, then building tools for our customers to migrate between GitHub on-prem instances and our hosted instance, then building 2fa enforcement features for our business customers, before finally landing in the Security department where I’ve been for nearly 9 years now.</p>
<p>In Security I’ve built multiple Rails applications but only one of them is still in heavy use. Funny enough it’s a stream processing application where the Rails MVC has been swapped out with Consumer, Enrichment, and Detection modules to handle the majority of our automated abuse detection and remediation flows processing billions of events per day.</p>
<p>I still work on the GitHub Rails monolith from time to time, but new Rails apps are rare for me now, and I miss it. There’s nothing like spinning up a Rails app from scratch and going from zero to usable in minutes. Rails made it simple to focus on the business problem and get something up and running quickly with the tradeoff that <a href="https://github.com/jonmagic/arca">scaling later may come with some headaches</a>.</p>
<h2>RailsConf 2025: Final Ride, Fond Farewell</h2>
<p>This week in Philadelphia they are holding the <strong>last RailsConf</strong>, concluding nearly 20 years of tradition. Ruby Central is <a href="https://rubycentral.org/news/announcing-railsconf-2025-and-a-new-chapter-for-ruby-central-events/">shifting focus to RubyConf and stewardship of RubyGems and Bundler</a>, while The Rails Foundation steps into Rails stewardship via <a href="https://rubyonrails.org/world/">Rails World</a>, which <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/david-heinemeier-hansson-374b18221_the-first-rails-world-sold-out-in-45-minutes-activity-7328326453291307008--DPg/">sold out Toronto in seconds</a>.</p>
<p><strong>DHH</strong>, creator of Rails, <a href="https://world.hey.com/dhh/the-last-railsconf-c6188593">shares the sentiment</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Few numbers exemplified the early growth… we bootstrapped something from nothing, turned it into an epoch‑defining event… RailsConf 2025 will be the last RailsConf… I raise my glass to the final RailsConf.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While I haven’t been deeply involved in the Rails community recently, as I prepared this post I learned how Rails World and RubyConf are shaping Rails’ future, and I’m hopeful for the aspiring or seasoned software developer that finds Rails and it changes their life like it did mine.</p>
<h2>A Thankful Reflection</h2>
<p>RailsConf gave me identity, community, and confidence. But more than anything, it connected me with incredible people, from the early Rails pioneers I met at conferences to the teammates who became lifelong friends, from mentors who shaped my thinking to fellow developers who challenged me to grow. The names and faces have accumulated over nearly two decades, each person adding something meaningful to my journey. The Rails community has always understood that great software comes from great people working together.</p>
<p>So this last RailsConf isn’t a swan song, it’s a celebration. My professional software development journey started here, and I’m deeply grateful. Here’s to the Rails way: convention over configuration, developer productivity, and a culture of collaboration. Thank you, RailsConf, and thank you, Rails community.</p>
<h2>One More Thing</h2>
<p>I haven’t created a Rails app recently but I still write a lot of Ruby and share most of it as open source including <a href="https://github.com/jonmagic/pocketflow-ruby">my port of pocketflow to Ruby</a>, <a href="https://github.com/jonmagic/scripts">my scripts project for AI workflows</a>, and a few of <a href="https://jonmagic.com/projects/">my other projects</a>.</p>
<h2>Feedback</h2>
<p>Feedback is welcome: <a href="https://github.com/jonmagic/jonmagic.com/discussions/7">discussions/7</a></p>
<p>Thank you for your time 🙏</p>
