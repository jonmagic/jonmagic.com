      <h1 class="site-title">New Team and Lessons Learned</h1>
      <p>The past few months I have been building a new team at <a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a> focused on solving problems for our business teams. Here are a few valuable lessons we learned along the way.</p>
<h3>Solving the right problem</h3>
<p>We solve problems for a living and we have one major constraint, our time. This means we need to be thoughtful in choosing which problems to solve. We cannot solve them all.</p>
<p>We decided to solve employee expenses at GitHub by building our own expensing system. We had evaluated <a href="http://expensify.com">3rd party services</a> and while they did 90% of what we needed, that last 10% made it seem like it was worth doing on our own.</p>
<p>What we failed to account for were the other opportunities, the other problems that needed solved, that ultimately would have a more lasting impact on GitHub.</p>
<p>If we use our company vision, to help people <a href="https://github.com/home">build software better together</a>, as a framework for deciding what to work on, choosing the right problem to solve becomes much easier.</p>
<p>We should be sensitive to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opportunity_cost">opportunity costs</a>. Solve the problem that will have the greatest impact with the lowest cost.</p>
<h3>Failing fast</h3>
<p>After choosing the wrong problem to solve we did not set clear goals so that we knew what success or failure meant. As a result it took us four months to realize we were working on the wrong thing.</p>
<p>Our first goal was to ship a system that received receipts, connected them to transactions, provided automatic and manual classification, and then entered the data into our accounting system.</p>
<p>The more I learn about software development, or solving any problem really, the more I realize a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winning_percentage">winning percentage</a> requires breaking down problems (and their solutions) into smaller and smaller pieces. Shipping quickly and constant iteration mean faster course corrections and less costly failures.</p>
<p>The fact that we could not easily break the expensing problem down into smaller pieces should have been a red flag.</p>
<p>We can reduce the costs of failure, both emotionally and economically, if we fail fast. We can’t fail fast unless we ship quickly and iterate.</p>
<h3>Do the simplest thing first</h3>
<p>We also started building a platform for different teams (and apps) at GitHub to be able to easily invoice customers. We dreamt up the perfect platform for invoicing, without having tried the simplest thing first.</p>
<p>The lie we often believe is that we understand what our constraints will be in a week, or a month, or six months and therefore we can save time by optimizing early. The truth is that we cannot foresee the future.</p>
<p>In the end we learned that invoicing integration needed to be built inside of the products it serves first. After it has been proven it can possibly be extracted into a shared service. This sounds like more work in the long run, but ultimately this process can adapt to change more quickly and easily.</p>
<h3>One more thing</h3>
<p>We could have avoided a lot of heartache and wasted resources if I had sought mentorship from people with more experience and context at GitHub.</p>
<p>For long term success I need to constantly be learning, which means keeping an open mind and a humble spirit. I look forward to the journey
