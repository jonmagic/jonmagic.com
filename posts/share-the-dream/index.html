      <p>Sharing in the vision and energy of your team is a key factor to success and happiness at work.</p>
<h3>Putting Your Dreams On Hold</h3>
<p>When I started at OrderedList there was <a href="http://speakerdeck.com">one product</a> I was really passionate about because I had done most of the work on it. I quickly realized though that I needed to put that passion on hold, or better said, redirect it towards <a href="http://harmonyapp.com">Harmony</a>, so that I could help push the vision of my team forward. I needed to share their dreams and hopefully incorporate mine at some point.</p>
<p>As soon as I dug into <a href="http://harmonyapp.com">Harmony</a>, fixing weak spots in the test suite, spearheading the move to Rails 3, working on a new feature (<strong>that I’m dying to tell you about</strong>), my heart began to change, my passion became their passion, and I was happy again and part of the team.</p>
<h3>Sharing The Energy</h3>
<p>Almost as soon as I really started getting passionate about <a href="http://harmonyapp.com">Harmony</a> John came home from sick leave and had this crazy idea to build a <a href="http://gaug.es">web analytics service</a>, which we now call <a href="http://gaug.es">Gauges</a>. At first all I could think was, <strong>boring</strong>, but hanging around Steve, John, and Brandon I started to catch the buzz, the energy, and the excitement!</p>
<p>This is when I began to realize that I didn’t necessarily have to put my dreams on hold, I just needed to share in my team’s excitement and get them excited about what I’m excited about by letting them see my own energy.</p>
<p>Every team is different, but letting your coworkers see your excitement and passion about a product/project and sharing in their dreams at the same time is one easy way to stay happy at work and be excited to go to the office every day.</p>
