      <h1 class="site-title">Why Should We Write?</h1>
      <p>Building a career as a programmer requires a lot of hard work, determination, and in my opinion a lot of writing.</p>
<p>How do you build a personal brand online? How do you get opportunities to work on awesome projects? How do you get invited to speak at conferences? Looking at my coworkers’ success I would deduce that you have to work hard on stuff you care about and then share the knowledge you have gained with your peers, writing on a <a href="http://orderedlist.com/blog/">blog</a> <a href="http://railstips.org/">for</a> <a href="http://opensoul.org/">example</a>.</p>
<p>Writing has always been a struggle for me, I was always a math geek, but I cannot use that as an excuse if I want to continually advance my career. If we are working online, building websites, doing design, programming web applications, or working on infrastructure, we need to be writing about our experiences.</p>
<p>We run into new problems every day. More often than not the solution is a <a href="http://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=what+is+the+answer+to+life+the+universe+and+everything&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8">Google search</a> away. But when it isn’t and we find a solution on our own, we should be writing it down and sharing it with the world.</p>
<p>Whether it’s writing <a href="https://github.com/jonmagic/grim#readme">readme’s</a> for an open source library, <a href="http://jonmagic.com/blog/archives/2011/10/06/grim-multiprocessor-to-the-rescue/">blogging</a> about how you solved a problem, or <a href="http://jonmagic.com/blog/archives/2011/10/03/just-write-it-down/">sharing some insight</a> about how to become a better person, I think we should all be writing more and sharing it with the world.</p>
<p>Let’s become better communicators thru practice, making the world a better place while at the same time advancing our careers.</p>
