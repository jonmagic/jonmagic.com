      <h1 class="site-title">Rapid Onsite Software Development</h1>
      <p>My uncle has been bugging me to help him with writing some software for awhile now, and this last weekend he sent me another email with a new idea, to help him in his business. I had some time available this week, so I decided to drive down to his shop and try something. My goal was to take his simple idea, boil it down to its essence, and write the whole application in a day using <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.com">Rails</a>.</p>
<p>To prepare myself I started working on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development">TDD</a> again, using <a href="http://thoughtbot.com/projects/shoulda/">shoulda</a> and <a href="http://thoughtbot.com/projects/factory_girl">factory_girl</a>. I also built my own version of <a href="http://github.com/fudgestudios/bort/tree/master">bort</a> from the ground up, called <a href="http://github.com/jonmagic/pudding/">pudding</a> (it has a couple flavors, including <a href="http://github.com/jonmagic/pudding/tree/vanilla">vanilla</a> and <a href="http://github.com/jonmagic/pudding/tree/tapioca">tapioca</a>). I tried to find the right mix of features to give myself a running start when I arrived onsite.</p>
<p>I arrived at 8:30am this morning and started programming at 9am. At first things were going fairly well, building my models out using TDD went fast, and I was rolling along nicely on writing my controllers using TDD when I hit a wall, aka, lack of knowledge on my part. After hitting this wall for 45 minutes I finally gave up on TDD and just went back to my old way of doing things, i.e. no testing.</p>
<p>I was back on a roll again, using my <a href="https://github.com/jonmagic/webapp_gui/tree">osx theme</a> for the admin interface, and <a href="http://www.blueprintcss.org/">blueprint</a> for the css reset, typography, and layout on the technician facing part of the application (the part that will be used the most).</p>
<p>Things were going along nicely until I ran into issues with the way I was doing ajax modals, via <a href="http://jquery.com/demo/thickbox/">thickbox</a>. I’d already implemented quite a bit using thickbox, when I decided I needed to start over on my modals using a different library. So far I think I’m gonna use <a href="http://dev.iceburg.net/jquery/jqModal/">jqModal</a>.</p>
<p>So, at 4:30pm I called it quits for the day, realizing my “app in a day” dream was not gonna happen, although I believe I’m about a 1/3rd of the way there, which isn’t too bad.</p>
<h3>Lessons learned?</h3>
<ul>
<li>I need to work quite a bit more on testing, I need to know it like the back of my hand</li>
<li>I need to have a sample controller built out in my pudding apps, so I can do a bit of copy/paste when building my controllers</li>
<li>It would also be nice to include my osx theme, and blueprint theme in my pudding apps</li>
<li>I need to get better at jQuery, and find the best plugins for my different needs</li>
</ul>
