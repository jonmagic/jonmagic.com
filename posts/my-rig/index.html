      <p>Not that anyone cares, but I thought I’d post my current computer setup, hardware and software…</p>
<h3>The Hardware</h3>
<p>I’m the kinda guy that enjoys the bleeding edge (first Mac was an 867mhz PB), so five days after Apple released the new <a href="http://www.apple.com/macbook/macbook.html">Macbook</a> I had my company order one for me. I got a stock <a href="http://store.apple.com/1-800-MY-APPLE/WebObjects/AppleStore.woa/6344003/wo/pQ4GzSFdUzhy2yFxQOmq26OsQGg/2.?p=0">black Macbook</a> from Apple, and ordered 2GB of RAM and a 120GB SATA laptop drive from a third party retailer (can’t remember who)…</p>
<p>The day after the Macbook arrived my memory and harddrive showed up and I installed them. Needless to say, I will never own a Mac with less than 2GB of RAM after experiencing the difference between 512MB and 2GB.</p>
<p>This computer is fast, really really fast, and the 120GB of harddrive made it more than comfortable for having my entire music/photos/movies collection on my laptop, instead of just my desktop machine at home.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.apple.com/macbook/isight.html">iSight</a> camera is really nice too, although I haven’t really started using it for video conferencing yet.</p>
<p>I love having the black Macbook, but I don’t have anything against the white ones, they are really slick too. The black one does tend to show any grease transferred from your hands, which could drive someone with <strong>OCD</strong> nuts.</p>
<h3>Software</h3>
<p>Well first off, I’m running <strong>OS X 10.4.8</strong> now.</p>
<p>In addition I bought <a href="http://www.parallels.com">Parallels</a> and I’m running <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/pro/default.mspx">Windows XP Pro</a> and <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com">Ubuntu</a>. I use <a href="http://virtuedesktops.info">VirtueDesktops</a> to keep everything clean and easily switch between my OS’s. It is really a thing of beauty and I love to show it off to my clients and of course other geeks (I had it all setup when I went to <a href="http://railsconf.org">RailsConf</a>, so that was fun, being that only a few people out of the 100+ people with Macbooks had the same setup).</p>
<p>I use <a href="http://www.apple.com/ilife/">iTunes, iPhoto, iMovie, and iDVD</a> quite regularly. I gave <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/mail/">Apple Mail</a> a spin but ended up back with the <a href="http://gmail.com">Gmail</a> web interface as my preferred mail client.</p>
<p>For coding I use <a href="http://www.macromates.com">Textmate</a> and <strong>IMHO</strong> there is nothing better.</p>
<p>In addition to these I use <a href="http://chip.cuccio.us/projects/gcal">Gcal</a> (a webkit based Google Calendar client), <a href="http://mozilla.com">Firefox 1.5.0.7</a>, <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/safari/">Safari</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stickies">Stickies</a>, <a href="http://www.newsgator.com/NGOLProduct.aspx?ProdId=NetNewsWire&amp;ProdView=lite">NetNewsWire Lite</a>, Terminal, and a handful of other apps.</p>
<h3>Problems/Issues</h3>
<p>I’ll finish this post off by mentioning some of the hardware issues I’ve experienced with my Macbook.</p>
<p>The first was an inconvenient problem with the gloriously large trackpad. Due to its large size, and the poor (I hate to say poor, but how else can I describe it?) trackpad button design, the button would only work if I clicked within an inch of the center. This after two weeks of use. I found a nice little remedy (via Google) <a href="http://ibloggedthis.com/2006/06/29/an-origami-solution-to-the-apple-macbook-trackpad-squishy-button-problem/">using some origami</a>, and it hasn’t been an issue since.</p>
<p>The last and worst issue I can remember is when I got the <a href="http://forums.macrumors.com/showthread.php?t=213531">random macbook shutdown problem</a>. Four weeks after I started using my Macbook it started shutting down whenever it felt like. Fortunately it seemed to do it more at night and not during work hours. But after a few days it was doing it all the time. I called Apple and started going through their annoying diagnostics: installing the factory RAM, installing the factory harddrive, reinstalling the OS, etc etc. Finally I got an <strong>RMA</strong> and sent it in. <strong>BUT</strong>, it took 16 days for them to get it back to me, which was extremely annoying, especially after being assured it would be back in 7 days.</p>
