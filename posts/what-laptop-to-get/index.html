      <p><a href="http://jonmagic.com/post/1611565836/hey-mom-i-got-a-job">As you know</a>
I’m taking a new job. New job means new laptop, and I’m having a terrible time deciding what Mac to get. Just browsing Apple’s website I fell in love with the new <a href="https://www.apple.com/macbookair/">13” Macbook Air</a>, but the feedback on Twitter has been 50/50 for/against. Some think it works just fine as a development machine, especially with the rockin’ SSD and 4GB of RAM, but others worry that going from MBP to the Air will leave you wanting.</p>
<p>I’ve been using a 15” 2.53 GHz Core 2 Duo Macbook Pro with 4GB of RAM for a few months now, and even it is not fast enough for me (looks like it’s the HDD that’s the bottleneck most of the time though).</p>
<p>I figured I needed some hands on, so I stopped by our <a href="http://gowalla.com/spots/6424797">new Apple store in Mishawaka</a> today and played with several different models.</p>
<p><strong>11” Macbook Air:</strong> this thing is tiny. I liked it except for the giant surround around the screen, it makes the screen look way too small. Give me a 1/2 to 3/4 bezel, not an inch and a quarter!</p>
<p><strong>13” Macbook Air:</strong> wow is she pretty, but it would definitely take some getting used to. It has the same number of pixels as my 15” but crammed into a 13” screen. I do love the weight to size ratio though. I couldn’t really run any speed tests, but the thing was dang fast from what I could tell.</p>
<p><strong>15” Macbook Pro:</strong> I tried out one of the i5’s with 8GB of RAM and an SSD and it was screaming. The only downside is the thickness/weight.</p>
<p>My conclusion at this moment in time is that Apple needs to make me a 15” Macbook Air! I don’t need an optical drive, I want tons of pixels, but I also want that bigger 15” screen. Imagine a 15” with an i5 processor, still super thin, and a 10 hour battery, all weighing under 4 pounds. I say hot hot hot…</p>
<p>I know it’s a pipe dream, but hey, boys gotta dream sometimes right?</p>
<p>I’d love to hear from anyone using the new Macbook Air, what has your experience been?</p>
