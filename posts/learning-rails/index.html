      <h1 class="site-title">Learning Rails</h1>
      <p>Wow, what a couple of weeks (months) it has beenâ€¦</p>
<p>My intro to <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.com">rails</a> began a few months ago when a <a href="http://xian.mintchaos.com">good friend and webdev guy</a> told me he was using it heavily and suggested I check it outâ€¦ I have never had any real programming experience and while the <a href="http://wiki.rubyonrails.com/rails/pages/RailsAcademy">rails intro video</a> was cool I just couldnâ€™t really get into it (scared, I think). SO, I stayed away for a little while, then came back and jumped on the bandwagon by adopting <a href="http://typo.leetsoft.com/trac/wiki">Typo</a>, a nice little blogging app with a lot of functionality, all built on <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.com">rails</a>â€¦ this saved me from having to learn how to program for a few more months and started to whet my appetite to learn more.</p>
<p>Then, about 4 weeks ago someone (who shall remain nameless) looked me up and asked me to build a web appâ€¦ I could have shoved the project off on Joshaven, but he is already crazy busy, so I decided to commit. No more hiding in the shadows, no more chickening out because I donâ€™t know how to program, no more excusesâ€¦ SO, I warned the client that I had no idea what I was doing and asked if he was still willing to pay me, and he was ðŸ˜ƒ so now Iâ€™m knee deep in this stuff and itâ€™s only getting deeperâ€¦</p>
<p>After throwing together a pretty much non-functional demo, and convincing myself that I could do this, I decided I needed to read a book on programming in Ruby before I could really get comfortable in rails. So I ran on down to <a href="http://www.poignantguide.net/ruby/">whyâ€™s poignant guide to ruby</a> and finished it in a weekend. Since then life has been a lot easier, at least as far as programming goes.</p>
<p>So I jumped back into the project, started from scratch, and built a highly functional, even pretty, demo in 20 hours (two days)â€¦ The client liked it and my friends and family even checked it out. That was Tuesday of last week.</p>
<p>Today is Sunday, although by the time I post this it will be Monday. I spent 3 days trying to get RMagick installed on my computer, finally succeeding late last night. Since then Iâ€™ve revamped version 1 of the webapp to run faster, use better naming schemes, and have cleaner code all around (thanx for the input <a href="http://xian.mintchaos.com">xian</a>, I took your advice on combining controllers).</p>
<p>And that is my learning <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.com">rails</a> experience. Five slow months of avoiding the inevitable and then four crazy <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.com">rubyonrails</a> filled weeks.</p>
