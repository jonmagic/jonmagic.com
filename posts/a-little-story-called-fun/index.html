      <h1 class="site-title">A little story called fun</h1>
      <p>This last weekend I took my wife to Chicago for her birthday, and her best friend flew in from Boston to join us. We had a wonderful weekend, they got to go shopping, we all got to eat amazing food, and I managed to talk them into going to blues and piano joints rather than dance clubs (except for one place that had Jazz upstairs and dancing downstairs).</p>
<p>Sunday before taking Michelle to the airport we all went to Ikea so Natalie could do SOME MORE shopping 😃 Michelle and I were kinda tired, and bored, so while sitting on a very nice leather couch I suggested we play a game. We would co-write a book, taking turns, using our phones and facebook status. The rules were: no more than 255 characters per post (I think Michelle’s was limited to 140), and no colluding. So basically we didn’t set up the story in any way, it just worked itself out as we went along.</p>
<p>The game ended up being tremendously fun, and got us through the better part of the day, including an hour or two of the time Michelle had to spend in the airport, because her flight was delayed. Because we were doing this on facebook, and it would only make sense if you were friends with BOTH of us and saw the updates coming in sync, a lot of people thought we were absolutely off our rockers. In fact, this comment to Michelle from her friend pretty much sums up what it must have looked like:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>DeAnna: sometimes i read your status updates and think you are on crack.<br>
i think a crackberry is bad for someone already addicted to crack….</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>p.s. i would have called you this weekend, but clearly you are having fun with your bffs. and taking lots of crack. so later this week?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you were one of those people only getting half the story, I’ve included the whole thing if you click thru to read the rest of this post 😃 Enjoy</p>
<h3>The Beginning</h3>
<p>2:20pm Jonathan woke to the phone ringing. Ok ok he thought, and slid his finger across the face of the iphone to answer it</p>
<p>2:22pm Michelle was on the other end of the line, “That’s it Jonny-Boy, we’re done for”</p>
<p>2:25pm Jonathan jerked the rest of the way to consciousness. “what!” he screamed! “You didn’t stop the package in time?”</p>
<p>2:28pm Michelle, stunned by Jon’s reaction lost composure. “ME?? ME not stop the package in time!!! since when was that</p>
