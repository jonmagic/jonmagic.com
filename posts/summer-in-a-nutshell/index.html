      <h1 class="site-title">Summer in a nutshell</h1>
      <p>Last year I got married. Natalie and I had bought a house in Elkhart, Indiana, and we moved there the same week we married and have been making a home here since then. My memory is so bad I canâ€™t remember what we did last fall, winter, or spring, but I do remember most of this summer ðŸ˜ƒ</p>
<p>Natalie started a new job this summer and is loving it. Late spring I picked up a bad habit, gaming, and it has stuck with me through the summer. More notable is our vacation in June, where my brother-in-law and sister-in-law came up to stay with us, and we rocked Elkhart AND Chicago ðŸ˜ƒ</p>
<p>But the most important thing that happened this summer in our lives wasnâ€™t even something that happened directly to us. My parents finally got all their support (to become missionaries), spent a couple months getting ready, and flew to Argentina to start new lives as church planters (these events did not necessarily happen in that order). This has affected us thoughâ€”now neither Natalie nor I have parents close by. The closest immediate relative is my sister, an hour away.</p>
<p>As summer closes up we reflect. It was a good summer, full of life changes, some surprises, many blessings, and a few hard times.</p>
