      <h1 class="site-title">A WebDev&#39;s notes on native Android/iPhone app development</h1>
      <p>I was contracted to build a fairly simple phototherapy treatment time calculator app for one of our clients recently, and in the process learned A LOT about developing for the iPhone and Android using html/css/javascript.</p>
<p>The requirements for the job were that the final app feel native and that it be able to be purchased on the respective market place (Appstore or Android Market).</p>
<p>I’d already written the <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/daavlin-phototherapy-dose/id386168638?mt=8">app once for the iPhone</a>, using the <a href="http://www.jqtouch.com/">jqTouch</a> library and then wrapping the whole thing with <a href="http://www.phonegap.com/">PhoneGap</a>, but this time around the client wanted to add some features that made me look further than jqTouch.</p>
<p>Initially I fantasized about a write once deploy twice approach using something like <a href="http://www.appcelerator.com/products/titanium-mobile-application-development/">Appcelerator Titanium</a>. The more I read however the more I realized no matter how I went about this project I was going to end up with more than one codebase, one for the iPhone and at least one for the Android. I decided to go ahead with Appcelerator however and developed for the iPhone first. One of the biggest things I was looking for was a native bottom tab bar for navigating between the different phototherapy calculators (UVB, UVA, UVA1, and Blue), and Appcelerator let me quickly build a native, beautiful, functional app that exactly fit the clients needs.</p>
<p>After a bit of troubleshooting I had it deploying to my actual iPhone, but no matter how hard I tried I could never manage to get it to deploy to the Android emulator.</p>
<p>Next I started working on a <a href="http://www.sencha.com/products/touch/">Sencha Touch</a> version of the app, which I planned to wrap with PhoneGap, but after about an hour of digging around in Sencha I decided it didn’t fit my programming aesthetic. I also talked to someone who wrote an app in Sencha and they said it had a ways to go with speed, animations were still jerky on older hardware.</p>
<p>Finally I decided to give <a href="http://jquerymobile.com/">JqueryMobile</a> a try (thanx Xian!) and it was a great fit for a webdev like me. Using the latest PhoneGap and JqueryMobile I had the app rewritten and running on the Android Emulator in just under 2 hours, and then another 2 hours tweaking the interface and interactions. If you know html/css/javascript, you can write a fairly native feeling app in no time with JqueryMobile.</p>
<p>Having used jqTouch, Appcelerator, JqueryMobile, PhoneGap, and having looked at Sencha, I have to say Appcelerator was by far the best experience. I enjoyed programming the interface rather than laying out the html and then styling it with CSS. I enjoyed how quickly and easy it was to deploy to the iPhone (I wish it could do the same for Android!). Most of all I loved how it built a native interface, which beats an html5 interface almost every time in my opinion.</p>
