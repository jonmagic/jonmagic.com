      <p>This summer my wife and I planned a trip to Boston for our best friend’s wedding. While getting ready to book a room I came across <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/07/25/fawlty-logic/">an article</a> about <a href="http://airbnb.com">airbnb.com</a>, so I decided to give it a try. The first 3 attempts to get a room failed, but each time Airbnb sent me a better coupon so I kept trying. The fourth attempt got me <a href="http://www.airbnb.com/rooms/45987">46 Monument Avenue</a>, and it was the best purchase I’ve made in a year.</p>
<p>For a very reasonable price ($100 per night) we got a cute studio apartment with a private patio, in Charlestown, just a short distance from the North Side.</p>
<p>The host, Atef Aziz, emailed us before arrival to find out more about us. He was helpful enough to get us into the room at 10am on our check-in day, rather than having to wait until 3 or 4pm (like most hotels). He was eager to help in any way, from walking or driving directions, to restaurant recommendations.</p>
<p>The apartment is adorable, a studio apartment with a nice large bathroom and stand-up shower. It had a functional kitchen (larger than our kitchen at home), washer/dryer, TV with basic channels, Wi-Fi internet, and an amazing little patio. The patio has a fountain with goldfish, a table with umbrella and chairs, a charcoal grill (the only way to grill), and lots of flowers and fauna. The apartment was only a 10-minute walk to the North Side of Boston and an 8-minute walk to the T (orange line).</p>
<p>The shower was initially not as hot as I like my showers, but a quick email to Atef got that fixed. The apartment was small, but open, and the kitchen entirely usable. The first night it was a bit warm, so I mentioned it to Atef and he got us a fan, which fixed the problem. The patio was perfect for relaxing in the morning, hanging out during the day, and winding down at night.</p>
<p>I can’t recommend <a href="http://www.airbnb.com/rooms/45987">46 Monument Avenue</a> and Atef Aziz enough. From his hospitality to the beautifully furnished accommodations, this stay in Boston was a delight.</p>
