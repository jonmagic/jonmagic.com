    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2006, Chicago.&lt;/strong&gt; Nearly everyone at the first RailsConf tapped away on a MacBook, except about fifty rebels. My friend &lt;a href=&quot;http://mintchaos.com/&quot;&gt;Christian Metts&lt;/a&gt;, who had &lt;a href=&quot;https://jonmagic.com/posts/ten-years-a-software-engineer/&quot;&gt;introduced me to Rails&lt;/a&gt;, and I printed &lt;a href=&quot;https://jonmagic.com/images/posts/farewell-railsconf-and-thank-you-for-everything/certificate.webp&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Certificates of Nonconformity&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, forged Bill Gates‚Äô and Linus Torvalds‚Äô signatures, and handed them to the non-MacBook crowd &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/mintchaos/albums/72157594176520552/&quot;&gt;while Christian snapped photos of each proud hold-out&lt;/a&gt;, including the elusive &lt;em&gt;why the lucky stiff&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://jonmagic.com/images/posts/farewell-railsconf-and-thank-you-for-everything/why-the-lucky-stiff.webp&quot; alt=&quot;why the lucky stiff holding a certificate of nonconformity&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That playful moment, the community, and the shared curiosity, set the tone for everything that followed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Finding Rails &amp;amp; Finding My People&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like many, using Rails was &lt;a href=&quot;https://jonmagic.com/posts/ten-years-a-software-engineer/&quot;&gt;the forcing function for me to learn Ruby&lt;/a&gt; (with help from &lt;a href=&quot;https://poignant.guide/&quot;&gt;why‚Äôs poignant guide to Ruby&lt;/a&gt; üôè), and that first conference pushed me deeper. Soon after, I drove to a Ruby meetup at Notre Dame and met &lt;a href=&quot;https://johnnunemaker.com/&quot;&gt;John Nunemaker&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://orderedlist.com/&quot;&gt;Steve Smith&lt;/a&gt;. One afternoon over beers at Fiddler‚Äôs Hearth in South Bend, they vented about SlideShare‚Äôs terrible user experience. I opened my terminal, installed ImageMagick, and hacked together a PDF-to-image converter on the spot. That bar-top prototype grew into &lt;a href=&quot;https://speakerdeck.com/&quot;&gt;Speaker Deck&lt;/a&gt; and my first &lt;strong&gt;RubyGem&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://jonmagic.com/posts/grim/&quot;&gt;Grim&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Building Businesses on Rails&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In December 2010 I became OrderedList‚Äôs first full-time developer, joining Steve, John, and later &lt;a href=&quot;https://opensoul.org/&quot;&gt;Brandon Keepers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://madebygraham.com/&quot;&gt;Matt Graham&lt;/a&gt;. We iterated on their first product Harmony, launched Speaker Deck to the public, and shipped &lt;a href=&quot;http://gaug.es/&quot;&gt;Gaug.es&lt;/a&gt;, a Rails-based analytics tool born from our dislike of Google Analytics. Consulting gigs on products like &lt;em&gt;Words With Friends&lt;/em&gt; paid the bills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through meetups and conferences our team met the GitHub co-founders and early employees such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://adaptivepatchwork.com/&quot;&gt;Tim Clem&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://zachholman.com/&quot;&gt;Zach Holman&lt;/a&gt;. In the fall of 2011 GitHub invited us to join as their first &lt;strong&gt;acqui-hire&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://jonmagic.com/images/posts/farewell-railsconf-and-thank-you-for-everything/orderedlist-joins-github.webp&quot; alt=&quot;OrderedList joins GitHub&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A GitHub Career&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After our acquihire in late 2011, I worked my way through nearly every department at GitHub building our support software (a Rails app called Halp), integrating our business systems with the GitHub monolith, building tools for our customers to migrate between GitHub on-prem instances and our hosted instance, shipping 2fa enforcement features for our business customers, and finally landing in the Security department where I‚Äôve been for nearly 9 years now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;markdown-alert markdown-alert-note&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;markdown-alert-title&quot;&gt;Note&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brandon, John, and I were among GitHub‚Äôs earliest users, with &lt;strong&gt;IDs #173, #235, and #623&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Security I‚Äôve built multiple Rails applications but only one of them is still in heavy use. Funny enough it‚Äôs a stream processing application where the Rails MVC has been swapped out with Consumer, Enrichment, and Detection modules to handle the majority of our automated abuse detection and remediation flows processing billions of events per day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://jonmagic.com/images/posts/farewell-railsconf-and-thank-you-for-everything/building-hamzo-at-an-offsite.webp&quot; alt=&quot;building hamzo at an offsite&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still work on the GitHub Rails monolith from time to time, but new Rails apps are rare for me now, and I miss it. There‚Äôs nothing like spinning up a Rails app from scratch and going from zero to usable in minutes. Rails made it simple to focus on the business problem and get something up and running quickly with the tradeoff that &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jonmagic/arca&quot;&gt;scaling later may come with some headaches&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Last RailsConf&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week in Philadelphia they are holding the &lt;strong&gt;last RailsConf&lt;/strong&gt;, concluding nearly 20 years of tradition. Ruby Central is &lt;a href=&quot;https://rubycentral.org/news/announcing-railsconf-2025-and-a-new-chapter-for-ruby-central-events/&quot;&gt;shifting focus to RubyConf and stewardship of RubyGems and Bundler&lt;/a&gt;, while The Rails Foundation steps into Rails stewardship via &lt;a href=&quot;https://rubyonrails.org/world/&quot;&gt;Rails World&lt;/a&gt;, which &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/posts/david-heinemeier-hansson-374b18221_the-first-rails-world-sold-out-in-45-minutes-activity-7328326453291307008--DPg/&quot;&gt;sold out Toronto in seconds&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DHH&lt;/strong&gt;, creator of Rails, &lt;a href=&quot;https://world.hey.com/dhh/the-last-railsconf-c6188593&quot;&gt;shares the sentiment&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúFew numbers exemplified the early growth‚Ä¶ we bootstrapped something from nothing, turned it into an epoch‚Äëdefining event‚Ä¶ RailsConf 2025 will be the last RailsConf‚Ä¶ I raise my glass to the final RailsConf.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I haven‚Äôt been deeply involved in the Rails community recently, as I prepared this post I learned how Rails World and RubyConf are shaping Rails‚Äô future, and I‚Äôm hopeful for the aspiring or seasoned software developer that finds Rails and it changes their life like it did mine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A Thankful Reflection&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RailsConf gave me identity, community, and confidence. But more than anything, it connected me with incredible people, from the early Rails pioneers I met at conferences to the teammates who became lifelong friends, from mentors who shaped my thinking to fellow developers who challenged me to grow. The names and faces have accumulated over nearly two decades, each person adding something meaningful to my journey. The Rails community has always understood that great software comes from great people working together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So this last RailsConf isn‚Äôt a swan song, it‚Äôs a celebration. My professional software development journey started here, and I‚Äôm deeply grateful. Here‚Äôs to the Rails way: convention over configuration, developer productivity, and a culture of collaboration. Thank you, RailsConf, and thank you, Rails community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;One More Thing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven‚Äôt created a Rails app recently but I still write a lot of Ruby and share most of it as open source including &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jonmagic/pocketflow-ruby&quot;&gt;my port of pocketflow to Ruby&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jonmagic/scripts&quot;&gt;my scripts project for AI workflows&lt;/a&gt;, and a few of &lt;a href=&quot;https://jonmagic.com/projects/&quot;&gt;my other projects&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Feedback&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feedback is welcome: &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jonmagic/jonmagic.com/discussions/7&quot;&gt;discussions/7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your time üôè&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Adding client-side semantic search to jonmagic.com</title>
    <link href="https://jonmagic.com/posts/adding-client-side-semantic-search-to-jonmagic-com/"/>
    <updated>2025-07-03T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://jonmagic.com/posts/adding-client-side-semantic-search-to-jonmagic-com/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I recently rebuilt &lt;a href=&quot;http://jonmagic.com/&quot;&gt;jonmagic.com&lt;/a&gt; from the ground up with help from &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/features/copilot&quot;&gt;GitHub Copilot&lt;/a&gt;, transforming it from a boring &lt;a href=&quot;https://jonmagic.com/about/&quot;&gt;about page&lt;/a&gt; into a real blog and migrating over 100 posts from my old blog. After adding this much content, I wanted a way to make it searchable, but using &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.11ty.dev/&quot;&gt;eleventy&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&quot;https://pages.github.com/&quot;&gt;GitHub Pages&lt;/a&gt; meant there was no backend to rely on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of my projects these days involve building AI-powered features, so I started to wonder if it was possible to add semantic search that runs entirely in the browser, even on a static site? Turns out &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jonmagic/jonmagic.com/pull/5&quot;&gt;it is&lt;/a&gt; and with a little help from ChatGPT and Copilot I had it up and running in an hour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;video controls=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; poster=&quot;https://jonmagic.com/images/search-demo.png&quot;&gt;
    &lt;source src=&quot;https://jonmagic.com/images/posts/adding-client-side-semantic-search-to-jonmagic-com/search-demo.mp4&quot; type=&quot;video/mp4&quot; /&gt;
    Sorry, your browser doesn&#39;t support embedded videos.
  &lt;/video&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;Video Demo:&lt;/strong&gt; Semantic search returning posts that match concepts, not just keywords.
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The entire semantic search (including the model) runs on your device, inside the browser, using precomputed post embeddings. No server required!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Try it yourself: &lt;a href=&quot;https://jonmagic.com/search/&quot;&gt;Search jonmagic.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later I found out about &lt;a href=&quot;https://pagefind.app/&quot;&gt;https://pagefind.app/&lt;/a&gt; and did briefly consider it but afaict it doesn‚Äôt support semantic search and my site only has a little over 100 blog posts so I‚Äôm very happy with the solution I landed on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How It Works&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Embedding posts during build.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At build time, I use &lt;a href=&quot;https://xenova.github.io/transformers.js/&quot;&gt;@xenova/transformers&lt;/a&gt; to generate a vector embedding for each post. This happens in the build script:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// src/_build/indexVectors.js (excerpt)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; tensor &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;extractor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;textToEmbed&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;pooling&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&#39;mean&#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;normalize&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token boolean&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
updated&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;full&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;vector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; Array&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;tensor&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;data&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;metadata&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These go into a static &lt;code&gt;vectors.json&lt;/code&gt; file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Embedding queries in the browser.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the search page, as you type, your query text is embedded &lt;strong&gt;client-side&lt;/strong&gt; using the &lt;em&gt;same&lt;/em&gt; model (MiniLM-L6-v2). That means no server round-trips, and your queries are never sent anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// src/js/embedQuery.js (excerpt)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; pipeline &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&#39;https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@xenova/transformers@2.17.2/dist/transformers.min.js&#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; extractor &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;pipeline&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&#39;feature-extraction&#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&#39;Xenova/all-MiniLM-L6-v2&#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;embedQuery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token parameter&quot;&gt;query&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; tensor &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;extractor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;query&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;trim&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;pooling&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&#39;mean&#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token literal-property property&quot;&gt;normalize&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token boolean&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; Array&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;tensor&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;data&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Finding the best matches.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The browser calculates cosine similarity between your query embedding and every post embedding. The top matches are shown, sorted by score.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// src/js/search.js (excerpt)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;cosineSim&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token parameter&quot;&gt;a&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; dot &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; normA &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; normB &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; i &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; i &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; a&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;length&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; i&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;++&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    dot &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;+=&lt;/span&gt; a&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;i&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; b&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;i&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    normA &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;+=&lt;/span&gt; a&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;i&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; a&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;i&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What You Can Search For&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Topics:&lt;/strong&gt; e.g., &lt;code&gt;&amp;quot;project management&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;&amp;quot;learning new skills&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Questions:&lt;/strong&gt; e.g., &lt;code&gt;&amp;quot;advice for new developers&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fuzzy phrases:&lt;/strong&gt; e.g., &lt;code&gt;&amp;quot;why did I move to git?&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;&amp;quot;being acquired at work&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You‚Äôre not limited to exact words, vector search will match &lt;em&gt;related&lt;/em&gt; posts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What‚Äôs Next?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next I‚Äôd like to see if client-side &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrieval-augmented_generation&quot;&gt;Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)&lt;/a&gt; is possible.  That is, not only find relevant posts, but also pass their text into a client-side LLM that can summarize or answer questions &lt;em&gt;about my own blog&lt;/em&gt;, entirely on your device.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Uncertain Future of Coding Careers and Why I&#39;m Still Hopeful</title>
    <link href="https://jonmagic.com/posts/the-uncertain-future-of-coding-careers-and-why-im-still-hopeful/"/>
    <updated>2025-06-27T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://jonmagic.com/posts/the-uncertain-future-of-coding-careers-and-why-im-still-hopeful/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A friend of mine, bright, driven, and relatively new to programming, asked me a heavy question the other day. ‚ÄúDid I make a mistake? Did I choose the right career?‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question hung in the air. It wasn‚Äôt born from a bad day or a frustrating bug. It came from a much deeper place of anxiety, one that I suspect many in our industry are feeling right now. They saw recent waves of layoffs, they read the headlines about Artificial Intelligence, and they felt the ground shifting under their feet. The promise of a stable, in-demand career in tech, which seemed like a sure thing just a few years ago, now felt fragile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúI‚Äôm so early in my career,‚Äù they said, ‚ÄúI worry if I‚Äôll even have a job in a few years. It‚Äôs hard to stay motivated.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had to be honest. I hear them. Loud and clear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm no expert, and my perspective is limited to my own journey, roughly 28 years in the tech world, nearly 15 of those as a full time software developer. I‚Äôve seen a few cycles of boom and bust, but I‚Äôll admit, this moment feels different. When I first got access to GitHub Copilot a few years ago, I had my own panic. I‚Äôm in my 40s. Was I becoming a fossil? How could I keep up?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That initial fear, however, eventually gave way to something else, a fire. It was a rallying cry to push myself, to embrace my love for learning, and to continuously grow. It reinforced a mindset I‚Äôve tried to cultivate over the years, to constantly work to make my current role obsolete, because in doing so, I‚Äôm constantly working my way into my next one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the sober part of the conversation, the industry has pendulums. Companies hire like mad for whatever reason, and then they overcorrect with layoffs. It‚Äôs a stressful reality. Imposter syndrome, that nagging feeling of being a fraud, doesn‚Äôt go away. I still feel it. But over time, I‚Äôve learned to reframe it. Instead of feeling overwhelmed by all the brilliant people around me, I now feel a sense of awe and a desire to learn from them. It‚Äôs fuel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what about the elephant in the room, AI? My friend‚Äôs biggest fear was that AI will simply do what‚Äôs expected of a more junior engineer, making their role disappear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is where my hope for the future comes in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don‚Äôt believe we‚Äôre heading for a world where artificial general intelligence (AGI) makes human ingenuity obsolete. Look closely at every major breakthrough, even those in AI-driven medicine. It‚Äôs still humans pointing the AI down the right paths. Human creativity is the spark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I see is a future where AI handles the grunt work, freeing us up to focus on the truly human part of creation: the next step, the novel idea, the new invention. If we don‚Äôt have to spend five years of our early careers doing repetitive tasks, that isn‚Äôt a threat, it‚Äôs a massive opportunity. It‚Äôs an acceleration of our potential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This led me to a profound realization that now guides my work. We are all, collectively, building a giant, shared brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every time you write a blog post, answer a question on a forum, or push a project to GitHub, you are contributing to this massive corpus of human knowledge. The next generation of AI models will ingest that information. Your solution, your idea, your unique way of explaining something, becomes part of the shared intelligence of our species. When someone else, somewhere else, asks a question that overlaps with something you shared, they‚Äôll be able to build on your work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are not just leveling up ourselves when we write and share; we are leveling up all of humanity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, how do we thrive in this new world?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, we must become masters of context. The effectiveness of AI hinges on the quality of the information we give it. I‚Äôve started obsessively collecting my own context, transcripts, notes, ideas, with the goal of building a personal, searchable database that I can use to augment my own thinking and my interactions with AI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, we must learn to be shepherds, not just button-pushers. For those of us who write code, this means getting exceptionally good at describing problems and guiding AI to generate solutions. For our colleagues in non-engineering roles, it means learning to see opportunities for automation and building the AI agents to handle them. We all need to adopt a mindset of invention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, we must guard against brain atrophy. We can‚Äôt let the tool do all the thinking. Use AI as an accelerator, a tireless research assistant, and a pair programmer, but never as a replacement for your own curiosity and ingenuity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, did my friend make a mistake choosing to be a programmer?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Absolutely not. The barrier to entry for creating things with software will get lower, but this doesn‚Äôt devalue the profession, it transforms it. The demand for people who can solve problems, think critically, and apply human ingenuity will be higher than ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The future of this career isn‚Äôt about being replaced by a machine. It‚Äôs about being amplified by one. Our challenge, and our great opportunity, is to learn how to contribute to that giant, shared brain and use its power to build things we can barely even imagine today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Footnotes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Junior engineers are still essential (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.businessinsider.com/github-ceo-hiring-junior-engineers-interns-important-2025-6&quot;&gt;businessinsider.com&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>Peer feedback</title>
    <link href="https://jonmagic.com/posts/peer-feedback/"/>
    <updated>2023-04-25T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://jonmagic.com/posts/peer-feedback/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs that time of year again and I‚Äôm asking for peer feedback and writing feedback for teammates and realized I‚Äôve learned a few things about this process over the years that I think are worth sharing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Asking for peer feedback&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A close teammate and friend &lt;strong&gt;@kmcq&lt;/strong&gt; gave this piece of advice recently and it really stuck and has made this review cycle at work much more straightforward and enjoyable:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing that I‚Äôve found helps me write better peer reviews more efficiently for folks is for the requester to mention something that they‚Äôd like me to highlight: a project, quality, or whatever that I can speak to that adds evidence to what they‚Äôll be writing themselves. This helps focus things and saves a lot of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I took that idea and ran with it and when I started asking my peers for feedback I included links to things I wrote or code I shipped that they could reference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This greatly reduces the burden on the people you are asking but at the same time I don‚Äôt want to limit what they include in their feedback, so my requests went something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Would you be willing to provide me peer feedback? The feedback form has pre-defined questions but here are some potential areas from our IC expectations that I would appreciate feedback on and links to work related to those areas that I completed during this review cycle:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Leadership and Communication&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Provides substantial technical leadership to help others learn and grow
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;example 1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;example 2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Technical Contributions&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Demonstrates deep knowledge of data ‚Äì knows what data is needed, how to find new or missing data, connects disparate or ambiguous data
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;example 1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;example 2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Typically when I provide feedback I focus it on just one expectation or project so you could just pick one of those examples above that you feel comfortable speaking to or choose something else entirely. Critical but constructive feedback is welcome and desired. If there is something I can be doing better for you or the team please don‚Äôt hold back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would of course be happy to give you peer feedback if I can be of service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Writing peer feedback&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve been writing peer feedback two to four times a year for up to a dozen individuals for the majority of my 11 years at GitHub. Here are a few guidelines I use today that I‚Äôve learned over the years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When someone asks you for peer feedback, ask them to apply the advice above! It‚Äôs a lot easier and faster to write feedback when the range of possibilities has already been narrowed down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Address the feedback to them and not some third party like their manager.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Instead of:
‚ÄúI appreciate how Rachel gathers requirements from stakeholders and delivers high impact results.‚Äù&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prefer:
‚Äú&lt;strong&gt;Rachel&lt;/strong&gt;, I appreciate how you gather requirements from stakeholders and deliver high impact results.‚Äù
This feedback is for them‚Äînot their manager.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There should be no surprises when giving constructive feedback during a review cycle. I like to reinforce feedback I‚Äôve already given during the cycle, and if possible, provide examples of how I‚Äôve seen them improve‚Äîand encourage more of that behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

    <title>Year in review</title>
    <link href="https://jonmagic.com/posts/year-in-review/"/>
    <updated>2017-12-30T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://jonmagic.com/posts/year-in-review/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This year flew by with a couple life changing family events, several projects shipped at work, and a lot of learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://jonmagic.com/images/posts/year-in-review/IMG_5507.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;kite&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Family&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We took two family trips to Florida this year to visit Natalie‚Äôs parents. The first trip was after her father found out he had cancer and the second trip was to help her mom pack up and move after he passed away. Of course these weren‚Äôt easy trips but I cherish the time we had with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adalyn is growing up faster than I can comprehend most days. She‚Äôs opinionated, independent, and can be sweet and then harsh in the span of a few seconds. Right now I‚Äôm trying to learn how to help her concentrate on a task or project for more than a few seconds at a time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In August Natalie and I celebrated our tenth wedding anniversary (and fifteenth year together). My mom flew in to take care of Adalyn so that Natalie and I could get away for a few days. We flew to Portland and had a great time exploring a new city kid free!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final piece of big news is that Natalie is pregnant and due in April!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Work&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can‚Äôt go into detail about most of my projects now that I‚Äôm on the security team at &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/&quot;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;. I still write blog posts regularly but they only get posted to a private work blog. What I can talk about here is some of the cool tech I‚Äôve been learning and using.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://jonmagic.com/images/posts/year-in-review/IMG_4301.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;team&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;React, GraphQL, and design&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of my responsibilities is building workflow tools for a team of analysts. Most of these workflows are queues and the analysts have to review items in the queue as quickly as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We chose &lt;a href=&quot;https://rubyonrails.org/&quot;&gt;Rails&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rails/webpacker&quot;&gt;webpacker&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=&quot;https://reactjs.org/&quot;&gt;React&lt;/a&gt; frontend implemented in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.typescriptlang.org/&quot;&gt;Typescript&lt;/a&gt; that reads from a &lt;a href=&quot;http://graphql.org/&quot;&gt;GraphQL&lt;/a&gt; API using the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.apollographql.com/client/&quot;&gt;Apollo client&lt;/a&gt; library. We‚Äôve been able to build super fast and information rich user interfaces with this tech stack and we‚Äôre loving it for the most part.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing that hasn‚Äôt worked great has been combining multiple API‚Äôs into a single unified GraphQL API, specifically re-exposing the &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.github.com/early-access/platform-roadmap/&quot;&gt;GitHub Platform&lt;/a&gt; in our apps GraphQL API. We‚Äôve had to duplicate a lot of the objects the GitHub Platform exposes and whenever we want to expose a new object or field we have to touch half a dozen places in our codebase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thankfully the folks over at Apollo have built &lt;a href=&quot;https://dev-blog.apollodata.com/graphql-schema-stitching-8af23354ac37&quot;&gt;a server side solution&lt;/a&gt; but it‚Äôs implemented in javascript so we‚Äôre planning on swapping out Rails in our stack for a node app. We believe &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.apollographql.com/docs/graphql-tools/schema-stitching.html&quot;&gt;schema stitching&lt;/a&gt; will have a significant impact on our development speed and maintainability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve also spent a good deal of time reading about user interface design and applying that knowledge to the analyst workflows. I started by reading through &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mit.edu/~jtidwell/common_ground.html&quot;&gt;this site from 1999 by Jenifer Tidwell&lt;/a&gt; and am now reading her book &lt;a href=&quot;http://designinginterfaces.com/&quot;&gt;Designing Interfaces: Patterns for Effective Interaction Design&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Machine learning&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We‚Äôve deployed multiple models to production now and have pipelines for training, testing, tuning, and deploying new models. While I haven‚Äôt been very involved with the actual model building process I have been spending a lot of my time developing new features for us to use in our models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During model development our ML stack is &lt;a href=&quot;https://prestodb.io/&quot;&gt;Presto&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://jupyter.org/&quot;&gt;Jupyter&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://scikit-learn.org/&quot;&gt;scikit-learn&lt;/a&gt;. When it‚Äôs time to put things into production we use &lt;a href=&quot;https://airflow.apache.org/&quot;&gt;Airflow&lt;/a&gt; to train and tune models on a regular schedule and then the models are deployed as microservices in our &lt;a href=&quot;https://kubernetes.io/&quot;&gt;kubernetes&lt;/a&gt; cluster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Stream processing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the past few months we‚Äôve switched to publishing our signals as &lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/&quot;&gt;protobuf&lt;/a&gt; messages to &lt;a href=&quot;https://kafka.apache.org/&quot;&gt;kafka&lt;/a&gt; so that we can use any number of consumers and start experimenting with stream processing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We‚Äôre currently running two types of stream processors. The first is a Ruby app using the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/zendesk/racecar&quot;&gt;Racecar gem&lt;/a&gt;. This app has let us experiment quickly with new streams and has helped us enable everyone on the team to do some basic stream processing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second one we‚Äôve been experimenting with is &lt;a href=&quot;https://flink.apache.org/&quot;&gt;Flink&lt;/a&gt;. It is way faster and has many more features than our simple ruby consumer app but we‚Äôre still ironing out the development process for the rest of our team as you have to write Flink apps with Java, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scala-lang.org/&quot;&gt;Scala&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=&quot;https://kotlinlang.org/&quot;&gt;Kotlin&lt;/a&gt;. Our initial spike with Flink was in Scala but recently we‚Äôve been writing apps with Kotlin which I think we‚Äôll end up preferring to Scala or Java.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ten Years a Software Engineer</title>
    <link href="https://jonmagic.com/posts/ten-years-a-software-engineer/"/>
    <updated>2016-12-05T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://jonmagic.com/posts/ten-years-a-software-engineer/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Ten years ago I started programming professionally and now I‚Äôm a Senior Engineer at GitHub. This blog post begins with a retrospective and ends with what I‚Äôm looking forward to in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How did I get here?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Growing up I was always building, repairing, using, and teaching people how to use computers. With a steady stream of spare computer parts from my Uncle John and encouragement from my parents it was easy to get started and advance quickly. Most of my friends were into computers too and a couple of them got into software development but for some reason I didn‚Äôt start considering it seriously until 2006. I had done some html, css, and javascript hacking starting in the late 90‚Äôs but everything I had built up until 2006 was for myself (like my &lt;a href=&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20041015030645/http://www.jonmagic.com/melioration/&quot;&gt;first blog&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2006 everything changed when customers of my company &lt;a href=&quot;https://sabretechllc.com/&quot;&gt;SabreTech&lt;/a&gt; started asking if we could build software for them. The opportunity to make money was enough to get me interested and I asked my friends Christian Metts, Daniel Parker, and Joshaven Potter for advice and help. With their help we shipped a couple of projects for customers (&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jonmagic/foreverrememberme&quot;&gt;foreverrememberme&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jonmagic/sixsigmaforms&quot;&gt;sixsigmaforms&lt;/a&gt;) and I started to catch the programming bug. That same year I attended the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/mintchaos/sets/72157594176520552/&quot;&gt;first RailsConf in Chicago&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jonmagic/optik&quot;&gt;started building software to run SabreTech‚Äôs operations&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first half of 2007 we took on more projects including building a centralized billing system for a chain of tanning salons and a network and computer monitoring system with remote access infrastructure to make helping customers faster, easier, and cheaper. Programming work was still my secondary job though, my primary responsibilities were building, installing, and repairing computers and training people how to use them. At this point I was driving an average of 1000 miles per week for work and I would continue to do so for the next 3 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://jonmagic.com/images/posts/ten-years-a-software-engineer/jon_montana_big_other.png&quot; alt=&quot;lawrence kansas&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second half of 2007 brought major life changes including getting married and moving to Elkhart, Indiana. Shortly after moving I did a google search for ‚Äúruby south bend‚Äù and came across the SBRB group that met at the University of Notre Dame. I attended my first meeting that fall and met John Nunemaker and Steve Smith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the next three years I would continue doing programming projects for customers (&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jonmagic/jukeman&quot;&gt;jukeman&lt;/a&gt;), for my business (&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jonmagic/suitecs&quot;&gt;suitecs&lt;/a&gt;), for family (&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jonmagic/globalauto&quot;&gt;globalauto&lt;/a&gt;), and one &lt;a href=&quot;http://theprogrammingbutler.com/blog/archives/2011/10/03/the-history-of-speaker-deck/&quot;&gt;little side project&lt;/a&gt; with John Nunemaker and Steve Smith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That little side project &lt;a href=&quot;http://theprogrammingbutler.com/blog/archives/2010/11/18/hey-mom-i-got-a-job/&quot;&gt;turned into a job offer in late 2010&lt;/a&gt; and I sold my share of SabreTech to my business partners and started working full time as a software developer at Ordered List. Brandon Keepers joined our team a few weeks after me and then Matt Graham joined a couple of months after that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the course of 2010 our small team &lt;a href=&quot;https://gaug.es/&quot;&gt;built a new product&lt;/a&gt; while maintaining our existing products &lt;a href=&quot;http://get.harmonyapp.com/&quot;&gt;Harmony&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://speakerdeck.com/&quot;&gt;Speaker Deck&lt;/a&gt; as well as paying our salaries by consulting for companies like Zynga (we helped Zynga scale Words with Friends and helped design and build the javascript version of Words with Friends for Facebook).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along the way our friends at GitHub noticed our products and our work and in the fall of that year made an offer to acquire our small company. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/blog/993-ordered-list-is-a-githubber&quot;&gt;The five of us joined GitHub on December 5th, 2011&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://jonmagic.com/images/posts/ten-years-a-software-engineer/speaking.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;speaking at failcon&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since joining GitHub I have helped serve our support team, finance team, sales team, customers (specifically GitHub Enterprise admins and Organization admins), and now our security team by designing, planning, building, and maintaining software. I‚Äôve built and led teams along the way but my responsibilities have mostly been solving problems for my coworkers and our customers using software. Earlier this year I was promoted to Senior Engineer. This promotion was especially exciting for me as I looked back at the previous ten years and what it took to get here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What did I learn along the way?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So. Many. Things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The importance of &lt;a href=&quot;http://theprogrammingbutler.com/blog/archives/2011/10/20/mentors/&quot;&gt;mentors&lt;/a&gt; as accelerators to growth. Being a leader is often about &lt;a href=&quot;http://theprogrammingbutler.com/blog/archives/2014/11/23/intention-vs-perception/&quot;&gt;building trust, giving ownership, and avoiding surprises&lt;/a&gt;. That figuring out &lt;a href=&quot;http://theprogrammingbutler.com/blog/archives/2011/11/29/how-we-work/&quot;&gt;a process that works&lt;/a&gt; for your team matters. That &lt;a href=&quot;http://theprogrammingbutler.com/blog/archives/2014/05/22/deliberate-iteration/&quot;&gt;deliberate iteration&lt;/a&gt; paired with discipline is a driver for success. That &lt;a href=&quot;http://theprogrammingbutler.com/blog/archives/2013/05/15/business-with-pleasure/&quot;&gt;it is important to know your weaknesses and deal find ways to deal with them&lt;/a&gt;. That &lt;a href=&quot;http://theprogrammingbutler.com/blog/archives/2012/09/07/focus/&quot;&gt;focus&lt;/a&gt; is an ongoing struggle. That solving the right problem, doing the simplest thing first, and failing fast &lt;a href=&quot;http://theprogrammingbutler.com/blog/archives/2013/09/16/new-team-and-lessons-learned/&quot;&gt;are things I value&lt;/a&gt;. That listening to &lt;a href=&quot;http://theprogrammingbutler.com/blog/archives/2014/02/13/sleep-apnea-survivor/&quot;&gt;friends and family can save your life&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I‚Äôve written about all of those things already. So what haven‚Äôt I written about?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Retrospectives&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This blog post is a result of reflecting on the past 10 years so I figured talking about my process for retrospectives would be fitting. Consistent retrospectives are probably the largest contributing factor to who I am today compared to 10 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taking time every day, week, month, and year to analyze decisions I‚Äôve made, actions I‚Äôve taken, and the actual outcomes versus my expectations is how I learn what I need to change who I am into who I want to be. A recent example, taken from a personal &lt;a href=&quot;http://theprogrammingbutler.com/blog/archives/2014/11/17/swot-analysis/&quot;&gt;SWOT analysis&lt;/a&gt;, was that I have a tendency to talk over my peers when I get excited about an idea ‚òπÔ∏è As soon as I identified this behavior I started working to change it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A retrospective goes something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set aside distraction free time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Think about something that has happened, whether it was something I did or that happened to me.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consider the situation, how I feel about it, what I can do better the next time I‚Äôm in that situation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Follow up homework if needed. This could be anything from repeating the situation so I can get better at handling to reading about the subject to learn how other people think about it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Setting aside time is the hardest part for me, so I‚Äôm always keeping an eye out for these distractions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Social media&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Entertainment (TV/movies/podcasts/audiobooks)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Speeding through life&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Likewise these are opportunities for reflection that I‚Äôm constantly looking for:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After personal devotions (or meditation)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After receiving feedback (good or bad)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After pretty much every conversation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After reading, watching, or listening to something (entertainment made both lists!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The end of the day, week, month, and year&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like to write down the things I‚Äôve learned through my retrospectives and I often use frameworks like Start/Stop/Keep or a SWOT analysis to help me organize my thoughts and find patterns. This gives me a great opportunity to find repeating themes over the years and track my personal progress. And sometimes it even turns into a blog post üòÉ&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Where do I see myself going in the future?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve been interested in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning&quot;&gt;Machine Learning&lt;/a&gt; for the past year and recently took a new position at GitHub working on the Security team where I get to use my current skillset and learn some ML and computational statistics techniques. I‚Äôm really enjoying it so far and I think I‚Äôll be focused on Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence for the next few years. I‚Äôve also been hardware hacking as a hobby for the past few years so maybe I‚Äôll get to build that robot butler someday.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Intention vs Perception</title>
    <link href="https://jonmagic.com/posts/intention-vs-perception/"/>
    <updated>2014-11-23T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://jonmagic.com/posts/intention-vs-perception/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It is interesting to study the gap between the intention of communication and the perception of communication in the context of leadership. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to do X going forward‚Äù can be interpreted as ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre doing a crappy job at Y so we‚Äôre going to try X now‚Äù or ‚ÄúWe decided that it is better to do X instead of Y because we had a meeting you weren‚Äôt invited to since we don‚Äôt really value your opinion‚Äù and the list of interpretations goes on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my experience perception rarely matches intention, so figuring out how to change your message to get across what you actually intended is a fun challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are probably many ways to do it successfully, but I only have experience with a few so I‚Äôll share those (YMMV).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Earn the trust of those impacted&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earning trust takes time. Time spent learning about someone, how to communicate with them, what they are passionate about, understanding their fears.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like to take people out to lunch, video chat, pair program on a code kata, or help with a problem they are having.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the first opportunity to be a servant leader I think. Serve the people you lead and, more likely than not, you will gain their respect and trust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Give ownership&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When someone is going to change the way I work, what I‚Äôm working on, or who I‚Äôm working with, the psychological toll of that change can be greatly reduced if I feel like I have control over my own destiny.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I look forward to working with leaders that engage me and get me involved in the decision-making process. They ask things like ‚ÄúWhat do you think about doing X instead of Y; what would be the benefits and what would be the drawbacks?‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asking for, listening, and reacting to my feedback gives me ownership of an idea, even if it was not my own. Reacting is not necessarily implementing my feedback, but this process of involvement changes the way the idea was communicated and perceived.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Avoid surprises&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a bonus to talking one-on-one with everyone on a team about an idea before announcing it at a meeting or in an email. You avoid surprises. Turns out not many people enjoy surprises, unless it‚Äôs a surprise party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having an opportunity to hear and discuss an idea before it is executed gives me time to get comfortable with it. If you have gained my trust then I also feel like I have time to provide feedback before the idea becomes reality.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>SWOT Analysis</title>
    <link href="https://jonmagic.com/posts/swot-analysis/"/>
    <updated>2014-11-17T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://jonmagic.com/posts/swot-analysis/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In college I learned how to do a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SWOT_analysis&quot;&gt;SWOT analysis&lt;/a&gt; and I‚Äôve been using it in one form or another at work and in my personal life ever since.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update 5-19-2015:&lt;/strong&gt; The authors of &lt;a href=&quot;http://formswift.com/swot-analysis-guide&quot;&gt;this amazing SWOT guide&lt;/a&gt; reached out to me to let me know about their work. After reading my simple how to below, &lt;a href=&quot;http://formswift.com/swot-analysis-guide&quot;&gt;check out their full guide&lt;/a&gt; to learn even more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So why do I care about my strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats? Because I‚Äôm ambitious (both a strength and a weakness) and I constantly want to be better at everything I do and I want everything I‚Äôm a part of to constantly be improving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do I identify and analyze these areas with regard to my personal life or work life? I choose what I want to analyze (myself, a friend asking for feedback, an area of my job) and then sit down with a pen and paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I start by drawing a vertical line down the center of the page and then a horizontal line across the page. I now have four quadrants and I label them S, W, O, and T.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next I write down weaknesses and then strengths in their quadrants. You probably won‚Äôt be sharing this analysis with anyone so be brutally honest. Depending on your disposition you may find it easier to write down weaknesses than strengths, or vice versa. With time you‚Äôll get better at identifying both if you practice consistently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once I have an understanding of strengths and weaknesses, it is usually pretty easy to identify opportunities that capitalize on strengths and work to turn weaknesses into strengths. Likewise, threats are anything that could turn a strength into a weakness or further entrench an existing weakness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now you have to decide what action to take based on the opportunities and threats. After repeating this process a few times you start to see patterns and improve your process even more. Here‚Äôs an analysis I did on myself a few months back with regard to my work life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I noticed after this analysis that my first opportunity, ‚Äúlisten more‚Äù, was the most important thing to act on because it addressed several of my weaknesses while building on my strengths and lessened at least one threat. This is one pattern I look for now: opportunities that apply to multiple concerns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Try a SWOT Analysis next time you want to level up.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve never been good at New Years resolutions but this year has been different. Starting the year I decided to iterate on life in a much more deliberate way. Here are the results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Writing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm starting to understand how important it is to measure iterations in order to continously improve, instead of just changing things for the sake of change. Writing things down is the best way I have found to measure change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm on my sixth notebook for the year. I write notes when I get up in the morning, when I‚Äôm in meetings, when I handle email, when I‚Äôm reading, all throughout the day really.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I sense change I can look back at my notes and see the evolution of an idea. After testing change to see if the results are better than previous results I can identify patterns in the ideas I wrote down and repeat them or discard them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Scheduling&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago I started using a calendar, like for real.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(the first one is what my calendar looked like before I started using it consistently)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results have been dramatic. My work and life balance feels better than ever, I don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm dropping the ball anymore, and I rarely have to spend time thinking about what to do next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before I only used to schedule meetings, dates I had to be at. This barely worked, I would sometimes miss meetings, or I would get anxious because I would suddenly have the feeling I had missed a meeting (even though I hadn‚Äôt).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now every Sunday evening I schedule the upcoming week, from 8am to 5pm every day (¬±1 hour). I use &lt;a href=&quot;http://readdle.com/products/calendars5/&quot;&gt;Calendars 5&lt;/a&gt; on my iPhone and it buzzes me 10 minutes before my next scheduled thing and I use &lt;a href=&quot;https://flexibits.com/fantastical&quot;&gt;Fantastical&lt;/a&gt; on the desktop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have trained my brain to rely on the technology, by using it consistently. My error rates and anxious moments have been reduced to almost zero.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm getting more done at work, I‚Äôm exercising more, and I‚Äôm spending more time relaxing. What am I spending less time doing? Spinning my wheels because I‚Äôm not sure what to do next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Meetings&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of people have a visceral reaction to the word ‚Äúmeeting‚Äù. I used to but I don‚Äôt anymore. Every day I set aside time to meet with people. These meetings range from standups to work lunches to video calls to catch up with remote coworkers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As our company has grown I‚Äôve come to realize how important it is to be deliberate about spending time with people and not just shipping code. Without connecting it is easy to quickly become lost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every week I do at least one working lunch, I spend at least one hour on a video conference with a remote coworker, and I attend at least one planning meeting (whether it‚Äôs for my team or a team we interact with).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Staying connected to coworkers has improved my mental health 10X as well as improving my value to the company by being able to connect people and ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Figure out how you are spending your time (maybe write it down?) and then look for things to change. Try using tools and doing things you think suck (calendars and meetings oh my!). Measure the results. Do it all over again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Other notes:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Writing things down is &lt;a href=&quot;http://theprogrammingbutler.com/blog/archives/2011/10/03/just-write-it-down/&quot;&gt;a lesson I have learned before&lt;/a&gt; and forgotten. Why is it that good habits are so much harder to practice than bad ones?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I‚Äôm writing this during my scheduled time off today üòÉ&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I‚Äôm also deliberate about meeting with people outside of my immediate circle, inside and outside of work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I realize some people will laugh at me for just now starting to use a calendar, but I think I‚Äôve just now grown out of my 20‚Äôs ‚ÄúI enjoy chaos more than order‚Äù lifestyle.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    <title>Robots can do support too</title>
    <link href="https://jonmagic.com/posts/robots-can-do-support-too/"/>
    <updated>2014-02-28T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://jonmagic.com/posts/robots-can-do-support-too/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;GitHub launched the &lt;a href=&quot;http://atom.io/&quot;&gt;Atom beta&lt;/a&gt; this week and the response has been great. As the first day was winding down a coworker suggested we write an FAQ and add a robot to answer the frequently asked questions in the IRC channel where people were congregating. Here‚Äôs how we taught &lt;a href=&quot;http://hubot.github.com/&quot;&gt;hubot&lt;/a&gt; to do support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Questions and answers&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First my coworker gathered the questions that were being asked over and over again:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;where do I get an invite?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;is there a windows or linux version of atom?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how much will Atom cost?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next he wrote short and to the point answers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are you looking for an atom invite? Go to &lt;a href=&quot;https://atom.io/&quot;&gt;https://atom.io/&lt;/a&gt; and put in your email, or join the #product-invitations room.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are you looking for a windows or linux version of atom? We don‚Äôt have one yet, but we will in the future.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Were you inquiring in the channel about Atom‚Äôs price? We haven‚Äôt set a price yet, but expect it will be on par with the cost for similar editors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally he compiled the regular expressions that we could use in hubot to listen for people‚Äôs questions and then reply to them with the answers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token regex&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token regex-delimiter&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token regex-source language-regex&quot;&gt;invit(es?|ation)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token regex-delimiter&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token regex-flags&quot;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;windows&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;linux&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;i
&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;pric&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;e&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;ing&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;cost&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;i&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Training the robot&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile I used the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/github/hubot/blob/master/docs/README.md&quot;&gt;Getting Started&lt;/a&gt; instructions to fire up a hubot instance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using &lt;a href=&quot;http://shapeshed.com/setting-up-nodejs-and-npm-on-mac-osx/&quot;&gt;npm&lt;/a&gt; I installed the hubot and coffee-script packages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;npm&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;install&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token parameter variable&quot;&gt;-g&lt;/span&gt; hubot coffee-script&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next I created the hubot instance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;hubot &lt;span class=&quot;token parameter variable&quot;&gt;--create&lt;/span&gt; atomicHubot
&lt;span class=&quot;token builtin class-name&quot;&gt;cd&lt;/span&gt; atomicHubot
&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;git&lt;/span&gt; init &lt;span class=&quot;token builtin class-name&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;git&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;add&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token builtin class-name&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;git&lt;/span&gt; commit &lt;span class=&quot;token parameter variable&quot;&gt;-m&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;Create atomicHubot&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I started hacking on the script (this is the final iteration with my work and my coworkers).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-coffeescript&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-coffeescript&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;# Description:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;#   Replying to people in atom channels on freenode.&lt;/span&gt;
#

module&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;exports &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;robot&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

  isNotified &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;keyword&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; username&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    robot&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;brain&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;data&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;keyword&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;

      robot&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;brain&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;data&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;price&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;push username&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every so often I would test the script in hubot‚Äôs shell console.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;bin/hubot
&amp;gt; where can I get an invite?
hubot&amp;gt; jonmagic: Are you looking for an atom invite?  Go to https://atom.io/ and put in your email, or join the ##atom-invitations room.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next I installed the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/nandub/hubot-irc&quot;&gt;irc adapter&lt;/a&gt; in atomicHubot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;npm&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;install&lt;/span&gt; hubot-irc &lt;span class=&quot;token parameter variable&quot;&gt;--save&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;npm&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;install&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;git&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;add&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token builtin class-name&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;git&lt;/span&gt; commit &lt;span class=&quot;token parameter variable&quot;&gt;-m&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;Add irc adapter&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I needed atomicHubot to actually live on the internet and connect to the irc channel so I read the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/github/hubot/blob/master/docs/deploying/heroku.md&quot;&gt;Deploying Hubot to Heroku&lt;/a&gt; instructions. These required that I have the &lt;a href=&quot;http://toolbelt.heroku.com/&quot;&gt;Heroku toolbelt&lt;/a&gt; installed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Step 1 was creating the application on Heroku and configuring it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;heroku create atomichubot
heroku addons:add redistogo:nano
heroku config:set &lt;span class=&quot;token assign-left variable&quot;&gt;HEROKU_URL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;http://atomichubot.herokuapp.com
heroku config:set &lt;span class=&quot;token assign-left variable&quot;&gt;HUBOT_IRC_NICK&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;atomicHubot
heroku config:set &lt;span class=&quot;token assign-left variable&quot;&gt;HUBOT_IRC_ROOMS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;#channel-name&lt;/span&gt;
heroku config:set &lt;span class=&quot;token assign-left variable&quot;&gt;HUBOT_IRC_SERVER&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;irc.freenode.net
heroku config:set &lt;span class=&quot;token assign-left variable&quot;&gt;HUBOT_IRC_UNFLOOD&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;true&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Step 2 was deploying to Heroku.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;git&lt;/span&gt; push heroku master&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That was it, I didn‚Äôt have to do any trouble shooting, atomicHubot connected to the irc channel and began fielding questions!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adding this hubot to the irc channel helped reduce the number of questions we had to answer and increased the speed at which common questions were answered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are probably easier ways to setup auto reply answers in irc channels but hubot is a tool I‚Äôm familiar with and love to hack on. It only took a few minutes to setup and I‚Äôll probably use the same technique in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This may not work for everyone but hubot sure helped out in a pinch, give it a try sometime.

    <title>Sleep Apnea Survivor</title>
    <link href="https://jonmagic.com/posts/sleep-apnea-survivor/"/>
    <updated>2014-02-13T00:00:00Z</updated>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Almost two years ago a friend and my wife saved my life. They got me to go see a doctor because my sleep was a mix of bone rattling snores, deathly silence, and gasps for air. If this sounds like someone you know, help save a life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;I should have listened to her&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She wouldn‚Äôt say ‚ÄúI told you so‚Äù but I am certainly guilty of not following my wife‚Äôs advice several years ago to go see a doctor because I snored so loudly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I should have had more empathy for her situation, struggling to get sleep next to a roaring locomotive. Some nights she would go sleep in another room so she could be rested enough in the morning to go to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Resorting to the bathtub&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then there was a night in Lansing Michigan where I shared a hotel room with three friends while attending a tech conference. In the morning I found one of them sleeping in the bathtub, another with headphones on, and the other with his head wrapped tightly in a pillow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When they woke up they were exhausted, trying to laugh it off in order to resist the urge to kill me (something discussed during the night). They described my sleep as snores loud enough to shake both beds in the room, interspersed with moments of sweet blissful silence,&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New Team and Lessons Learned</title>
    <link href="https://jonmagic.com/posts/new-team-and-lessons-learned/"/>
    <updated>2013-09-16T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://jonmagic.com/posts/new-team-and-lessons-learned/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The past few months I have been building a new team at &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/&quot;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt; focused on solving problems for our business teams. Here are a few valuable lessons we learned along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Solving the right problem&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We solve problems for a living and we have one major constraint, our time. This means we need to be thoughtful in choosing which problems to solve. We cannot solve them all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We decided to solve employee expenses at GitHub by building our own expensing system. We had evaluated &lt;a href=&quot;http://expensify.com/&quot;&gt;3rd party services&lt;/a&gt; and while they did 90% of what we needed, that last 10% made it seem like it was worth doing on our own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What we failed to account for were the other opportunities, the other problems that needed solved, that ultimately would have a more lasting impact on GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we use our company vision, to help people &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/home&quot;&gt;build software better together&lt;/a&gt;, as a framework for deciding what to work on, choosing the right problem to solve becomes much easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We should be sensitive to &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opportunity_cost&quot;&gt;opportunity costs&lt;/a&gt;. Solve the problem that will have the greatest impact with the lowest cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Failing fast&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After choosing the wrong problem to solve we did not set clear goals so that we knew what success or failure meant. As a result it took us four months to realize we were working on the wrong thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our first goal was to ship a system that received receipts, connected them to transactions, provided automatic and manual classification, and then entered the data into our accounting system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The more I learn about software development, or solving any problem really, the more I realize a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winning_percentage&quot;&gt;winning percentage&lt;/a&gt; requires breaking down problems (and their solutions) into smaller and smaller pieces. Shipping quickly and constant iteration mean faster course corrections and less costly failures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact that we could not easily break the expensing problem down into smaller pieces should have been a red flag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can reduce the costs of failure, both emotionally and economically, if we fail fast. We can‚Äôt fail fast unless we ship quickly and iterate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Do the simplest thing first&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also started building a platform for different teams (and apps) at GitHub to be able to easily invoice customers. We dreamt up the perfect platform for invoicing, without having tried the simplest thing first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lie we often believe is that we understand what our constraints will be in a week, or a month, or six months and therefore we can save time by optimizing early. The truth is that we cannot foresee the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end we learned that invoicing integration needed to be built inside of the products it serves first. After it has been proven it can possibly be extracted into a shared service. This sounds like more work in the long run, but ultimately this process can adapt to change more quickly and easily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;One more thing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We could have avoided a lot of heartache and wasted resources if I had sought mentorship from people with more experience and context at GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For long term success I need to constantly be learning, which means keeping an open mind and a humble spirit. I look forward to the journey

    <title>Business With Pleasure</title>
    <link href="https://jonmagic.com/posts/business-with-pleasure/"/>
    <updated>2013-05-15T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://jonmagic.com/posts/business-with-pleasure/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Hi, my name is Jon. I‚Äôm an addict. It does not matter what it is‚Äîif it makes me feel good, I do more of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;But I Love It So Much!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love my job, or more specifically, I love the work I get to do every day. Combine my love for work with my addiction problem and I end up working too much and spending too little time with my wife, or reading a book, or taking a walk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When things are going well at work I have a sense of accomplishment, which feels good, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48-tcRiBNj4&quot;&gt;I want more&lt;/a&gt;. How do you get more of something? You just keep doing the same thing over and over again that got you that good feeling, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Being Honest With Myself&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right now I have no problem identifying that my line of thinking‚Äîdoing more of something will result in more pleasure‚Äîis wrong. When I am in a destructive cycle I am completely blind to this fact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A destructive cycle is wanting one thing too much and being blind to the costs of achieving it. We also call this being obsessed with something. Ultimately these destructive cycles lead to some sort of meltdown for me when &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diminishing_returns&quot;&gt;increased input does not lead to an equal or greater increase in output&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During a cycle I can‚Äôt stop thinking about whatever I‚Äôm obsessing about; I bring it to the dinner table, I bring it on a date, I go to bed with it. This damages my marriage and my mental health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thankfully I am getting better at recognizing and breaking these cycles. I can‚Äôt take the credit though‚Äîmy wife usually notices and starts to warn me early on. Learning to listen to her concerns is something I need to get better at. My last obsession lasted about ten days before she got through to me and I recognized the error of my ways. That was yesterday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Shortening the Cycle&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a few things I am going to try to shorten this cycle. The first is obvious: listen to my wife. But what if you don‚Äôt live with someone?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recognize the signs. If I am spending less time doing things that relax me, like reading, walking with my dogs, or doing chores around the house, these are pretty good signs I‚Äôm not balancing work and life very well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm trying out a checklist of sorts. It is just a long list of non-work things that I can do each day. I made this list by observing what has been healthy for me in the past. I‚Äôm not going to check off everything on the list each day, but doing three or four a day is a good sign, and doing one or none is probably a bad sign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make yourself accountable to your peers. If you know your signs, ask a coworker and friend to watch out for them. Most of the time someone other than yourself will recognize the signs much sooner than you will. There is a caveat: if you are going to make yourself accountable, you have to be willing to listen when they warn you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting it right feels great too. Excuse me while I add blogging to my list of non-work things to do.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Focus</title>
    <link href="https://jonmagic.com/posts/focus/"/>
    <updated>2012-09-07T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://jonmagic.com/posts/focus/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We just finished shipping a six month long milestone on one of our support tools at &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/&quot;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;. One lesson I learned along the way was focus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Make a Commitment&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I first heard about this project, the tool that handles all incoming support requests at GitHub, I was immediately intrigued and volunteered myself to help. Sitting down with the person who had developed the tool to that point and the support team, we came up with a few core things that had to happen, plus a lot of higher level todos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the time, our support tool was just a front-end to a popular customer care service called &lt;a href=&quot;http://tenderapp.com/&quot;&gt;Tender&lt;/a&gt;, that was actually built by a couple GitHub employees in their previous lives. The service had done its job for a long time, but it was clear that our needs were changing, and that we couldn‚Äôt rely on a third party service to meet them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I made the commitment to help achieve this goal and get our support system running on its own as a full fledged application inside of GitHub. I am not actually sure if I would have made this commitment if I had read through the codebase and understood what a long road it would be. Thankfully, in my gung-ho sorta way I just signed up on the spot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Frame All Questions &amp;amp; Answers&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having made the commitment, I dove into the project head first. I quickly became the primary developer on the project, with people coming in from other teams to help for a few weeks before returning to their other work (thankfully &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/spicycode&quot;&gt;@spicycode&lt;/a&gt; joined later as a full time member of the team). Along the way I learned that being the primary person responsible also meant that people came to me with their needs and wants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initially, being a people pleaser, I did everything in my power to fulfill their wishes and desires or promised to work on what they needed later. Quickly this became unsustainable and I became frustrated with my inability to fulfill those requests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I learned the right way to answer questions when asked. I had to frame every question, every want, every wish, in the context of my original commitment. Would satisfying their need further our core goals, and did I have the resources necessary to accomplish it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Learn To Say No&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the time during the last six months that answer ended up being &lt;strong&gt;no&lt;/strong&gt;. This was especially tough for me, I hate saying no, but I had to learn how to do it or risk losing my sanity and disappoint a lot of people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thankfully in many cases I didn‚Äôt have to say a flat no ‚Äì instead, we would channel the energy and idea into a feature request that we could talk about more down the road. All of these feature requests were recorded in GitHub Issues and revisited over the following months, taking new shapes, and in some cases being made obsolete by better and newer ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along the way, we implemented just enough to keep our support team happy, with all of their hair intact. Mostly, we focused on our core goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last night at midnight we flipped the switch to route all support requests thru our new backend. We still use Tender in a limited capacity for old discussions that are still open, but as time passes those will be archived and eventually we will be able to remove Tender completely as a dependency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In six months, we laid a solid foundation for the future of support at GitHub by staying focused.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>My Trip to Verona</title>
    <link href="https://jonmagic.com/posts/my-trip-to-verona/"/>
    <updated>2012-05-19T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://jonmagic.com/posts/my-trip-to-verona/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;As my plane broke through the clouds, descending into Verona, my eyes were met with seemingly endless farm land, a patchwork quilt, broken up by small patches of trees and wandering erratic roads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Day 1&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We landed at the small airport and for the first time in a decade I felt like a foreigner. I was in Verona for &lt;a href=&quot;http://2012.jsday.it/&quot;&gt;jsDay&lt;/a&gt;, having been given the opportunity to speak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After exchanging dollars for euros I hailed a cab. My driver must have been training for the grand prix as we zigzagged and raced around cars at 140km/h. The exhilarating ride ended at the hotel and my original notion that Verona was mostly flat was thoroughly dispelled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soon I met with my &lt;a href=&quot;http://github.com/bkeepers&quot;&gt;coworker&lt;/a&gt; and his wife who were in Verona on holiday and we jumped on a bus for &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Garda&quot;&gt;Lago di Garda&lt;/a&gt;. We spent the afternoon catching up, enjoying the scenery, and eating the local fare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jet lag began to sneak up on me as the sun moved into the western sky. We returned to the hotel and began making dinner plans, but before we could execute I ran into other speakers from the conference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Introductions were made, plans were changed, and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spritz_(alcoholic_beverage)&quot;&gt;spritz&lt;/a&gt; began to flow. At a local Pizzeria, one among hundreds in a several kilometer area apparently, we feasted on thin crust delicacies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We talked into the night, closing the pizzeria and then the hotel bar. A &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/shvi&quot;&gt;rag&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/seldaek&quot;&gt;tag&lt;/a&gt; group of &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/maboa&quot;&gt;many&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/couac&quot;&gt;nationalities&lt;/a&gt;, daring each other to try the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grappa&quot;&gt;grappa&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally around 3am I collapsed into bed, exhausted from the last 37 hours of travel and new culture acclimation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Day 2&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conference began with a &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/#!/jsconfit/status/202676559918804993/photo/1&quot;&gt;spritz&lt;/a&gt;. The talks were great and it was refreshing to catch up on the world of Javascript since I‚Äôve been so deep in Ruby for the past six months. Twice I had to retire to my room to lay down for a bit, jet lagged and exhausted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lunch was catered by the conference center and I mostly feasted on salad, cuts of meat and cheese, carrots, and cooked greens. Red wine was served and rivaled anything I‚Äôve had back home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point I must have been meeting new people at a rate of six or more per hour. English truly is the international language, at least in the programming community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the evening they took all of the speakers to the tallest tower in Verona, where I scaled 368 steps and then faced one of my worst fears, heights. It is so strange that I have no problem getting in an aluminum tube that hurtles around the world many thousands of feet above the ground without a second thought, but looking down from a twenty story tower makes me weak in the knees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After descending we walked across the piazza and sat down at the finest restaurant in Verona. The first glass was filled with Prosecco and I began meeting everyone around the table. Two Californians, a few from Italy, a couple from Germany, and the GitHub delegation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all enjoyed conversing, the three course meal and dessert, and of course more red wine. The meal was good but I felt like it was not much different in style or quality from what my wife and I cook at home. The dessert on the other hand, a cream with nuggets of pure chocolate heaven, was fantastic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After dinner we were bussed back to the hotel and a large number of us headed back to the pizzeria from the pervious night to join the conference attendees. I met more people, sampled the local beer, and once again we closed the place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once back to the hotel I settled in at a table in the bar with a Norwegian living in Italy and a &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/seldaek&quot;&gt;Belgian&lt;/a&gt; living in Switzerland. We talked into the wee hours of the morning over a couple of beers, discussing everything from nationalized healthcare to the perfect bolognese recipe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I finally climbed the four flights of steps to my room around 4am and kissed the mattress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Day 3&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going to bed so late prevented me from waking up in time to see Douglas Crockford talk in the morning, which was definitely a disappointment. I did make it to a few talks however and it was interesting to see what libraries and tools people were using around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right before my talk I took a power nap and awoke with an idea for how to engage my audience a bit more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before leaving my room I grabbed some &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mostarda&quot;&gt;mostarda&lt;/a&gt; I had purchased and on the way to the conference rooms I ordered a spritz from the bar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I began my talk about &lt;a href=&quot;http://theprogrammingbutler.com/blog/archives/2012/05/19/hubot-img-me-woman-laughing-alone-with-salad/&quot;&gt;Hubot the robot butler&lt;/a&gt; I walked out into the audience and asked whether they liked it when someone did something nice for them. They didn‚Äôt answer immediately so I singled out one young lady and asked her if she would like the mostarda or the spritz. She said either so I gave her the spritz and then held up the mostarda and asked who wanted it. A gentleman in the back said sure and I passed it to him and then headed to the front to start my talk. I had broken the ice, demonstrated a servants heart (a butlers heart!), and calmed myself down in the process by having some one on one interaction with the audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It felt like the rest of my talk went really well, my energy level was high, I didn‚Äôt stumble, and I actually hit my allotted time perfectly! There were even a few questions and light applause. But later I noticed there was only one tweet and no one really came up to ask me more about Hubot, so I‚Äôm wondering if either I spoke too quickly and was hard to understand or if my audience just didn‚Äôt really need their own robot butler.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the talk the usual wave of relief washed over me mixing with the waning adrenaline. Now it was time to prepare for hosting a GitHub drinkup!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found a group to have dinner with and we began our trek across the city. We sat down to a nice meal and the conversation was relaxed. Then I left them a bit early to ensure our venue was ready for the drinkup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arriving at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kbh.it/&quot;&gt;Kulmbacher Bier-Haus&lt;/a&gt; I found my coworker and his wife already there. I went inside and made friends with Tony the bartender, an energetic young fellow with blond hair. The entire staff were dressed up in cheesy Bavarian garb that put a smile on your face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the designated hour approached people started arriving and we took our place in the back of the restaurant. My coworker and I took turns greeting each new group that wandered in, asking them what they were working on, what they were excited about in their careers, and answering any questions they had for us. One question was oft repeated: ‚Äúhow do I sell my boss or clients on using git.‚Äù I honestly struggled to come up with anything they hadn‚Äôt already tried. Definitely something I need to study more and work on, as I haven‚Äôt ever had to sell git to a boss or client, I just started using it and didn‚Äôt give them a choice. Unfortunately that doesn‚Äôt work for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the successful drinkup a small group of us migrated to a quiet watering hole down the road, continuing unfinished conversations over a grappa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bar closed and we walked back to the hotel, me in the lead, arriving back at nearly 4am. With jsDay over I rested my head on the pillow and had my first good long night of sleep since arriving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Day 4&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As my eyes opened I realized it was nearly lunchtime, so I jumped up, dressed, and grabbed my Kindle. Leaving the hotel I found myself heading back to the trusty Pizzeria San Marco. I ordered wine and a pizza with prosciutto, fungi (mushrooms), and mozzarella. I spent my lunch reading &lt;a href=&quot;http://objectsonrails.com/&quot;&gt;Objects on Rails&lt;/a&gt; and thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was done a nap seemed in order so I returned to the hotel and layed down for a few more hours. Waking up for the second time that day I wasn‚Äôt sure what to do so I loaded my messenger bag with laptop and Kindle and headed towards the city center. It was a fascinating hike with beautiful sites and delicious smells, set to a soundtrack from my iPhone. I started with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rdio.com/artist/Danger_Mouse/album/Rome/&quot;&gt;Rome&lt;/a&gt; and then moved on to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rdio.com/artist/Django_Reinhardt/album/Sultan_Of_Swing/&quot;&gt;The Sulton of Swing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While crossing over the Ponte Pietra bridge into the touristy center I saw many people with Gelato so I tracked down the source and bought a small cup of Strachiatella, then found a bench overlooking the river and took my time enjoying the purchase. Around dinner time I found a touristy place and had a somewhat awful meal (never go touristy!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dinner complete I trekked back to the hotel and found a table in the bar to sit, read, and relax at. I enjoyed my last glass of wine in Italy (for this trip at least) and read &lt;a href=&quot;http://practicingruby.com/&quot;&gt;Practicing Ruby&lt;/a&gt; articles and watched &lt;a href=&quot;http://destroyallsoftware.com/&quot;&gt;Destroy All Software&lt;/a&gt; videos. Completely exhausted from socializing I avoided the party that night and retired to my room early.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a few short hours of sleep I rose, packed, and grabbed a much more relaxed cab ride to the airport.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As my plane rose into the sky I said ‚ÄúCiao Verona‚Äù and began writing my tale.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In the past month I‚Äôve had the opportunity to present this talk twice, first in London England and then in Verona Italy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before joining GitHub I met &lt;a href=&quot;http://zachholman.com/&quot;&gt;Zach Holman&lt;/a&gt; from GitHub at a conference in Colorado and heard about &lt;a href=&quot;http://hubot.github.com/&quot;&gt;Hubot&lt;/a&gt;. As soon as Hubot was released as open source we started using him at Ordered List and I blogged a simple &lt;a href=&quot;http://theprogrammingbutler.com/blog/archives/2011/10/28/hubot-scripts-explained/&quot;&gt;script writing tutorial&lt;/a&gt;, which is still my most popular blog post day to day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After joining GitHub I got up the nerve to write and submit a talk proposal and lo and behold two out of three of the conferences I submitted to accepted my talk. I gave this presentation first in London at &lt;a href=&quot;http://devslovebacon.com/&quot;&gt;DevsLoveBacon&lt;/a&gt; and you can find the &lt;a href=&quot;http://devslovebacon.com/speakers/jonathan-hoyt&quot;&gt;video of my talk&lt;/a&gt; on their site. A few weeks later I traveled to &lt;a href=&quot;http://2012.jsday.it/&quot;&gt;jsDay in Verona Italy&lt;/a&gt; and presented a second time!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are the slides from my presentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have any feedback on how I can make the talk better or any questions about Hubot please send it via &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/jonmagic&quot;&gt;Twitter @jonmagic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm really excited to let you know that we‚Äôve added full-screen support to presentations on &lt;a href=&quot;http://speakerdeck.com/&quot;&gt;Speaker Deck&lt;/a&gt;. This feature has been percolating for awhile, going thru several iterations before we found a solution that we really liked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are using the &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/Using_full-screen_mode&quot;&gt;new full-screen API‚Äôs&lt;/a&gt; available in Webkit based browsers and Firefox. There were a few obstacles we had to overcome, mostly just learning how the API‚Äôs actually worked, specifically how to make an element inside an iFrame go fullscreen (make sure to add the allow flags to your iframe tag).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the process we learned a ton of great stuff that will let us do some pretty cool things in the future. The way we designed full-screen will let us use higher resolution slides in the future as well (you know, in case we decide to start encoding them at the resolution of that new device Apple just released).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here‚Äôs a presentation I did awhile back, check it out in full-screen!&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Ever since &lt;a href=&quot;http://hubot.github.com/&quot;&gt;Hubot&lt;/a&gt; was released I‚Äôve been regular expressing myself. Here is a tool I built to make testing regular expressions in JavaScript easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://rubular.com/&quot;&gt;Rubular&lt;/a&gt; was my go-to for testing regex in the past, but it‚Äôs targeted at Ruby so I went in search of a nice editor for JavaScript regular expressions. Unfortunately my search yielded no results. Fortunately I had the tools and experience to build one!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://scriptular.com/&quot;&gt;Scriptular&lt;/a&gt; is the fruit of my labor. I modeled Scriptular after Rubular with one major difference: it doesn‚Äôt have a backend service‚Äîeverything runs in the browser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am really excited about Scriptular; I think it will be useful for developers everywhere. With its current implementation, you can test how a regex reacts in any browser by loading Scriptular in that browser and testing the regex. In the future, I would also like to have a backend service for testing server-side JavaScript implementations like V8.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So go &lt;a href=&quot;http://scriptular.com/&quot;&gt;kick the tires&lt;/a&gt;, give it a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scriptular.com/&quot;&gt;spin around the block&lt;/a&gt;, and let me know what you think. If you would like to help on the project, please &lt;a href=&quot;http://github.com/jonmagic/scriptular&quot;&gt;check it out on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Update: Thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;http://opensoul.org/&quot;&gt;@bkeepers&lt;/a&gt; for contributing the design.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New Tabs and Cucumber</title>
    <link href="https://jonmagic.com/posts/new-tabs-and-cucumber/"/>
    <updated>2012-02-07T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://jonmagic.com/posts/new-tabs-and-cucumber/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;While working on an internal app at &lt;a href=&quot;http://github.com/&quot;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt; I had to write a &lt;a href=&quot;http://cukes.info/&quot;&gt;cucumber&lt;/a&gt; scenario that ran expectations against a new tab that was opened. Here is how I did it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Code&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Searching around the internet, I finally found a tip on &lt;a href=&quot;http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3104348/ruby-on-rails-cucumber-how-do-i-follow-a-link-that-opens-a-new-window&quot;&gt;StackOverflow&lt;/a&gt; that got me moving in the right direction. In this context tabs are referred to as windows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ruby&quot;&gt;page&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;driver&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;browser&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;switch_to&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;window&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;page&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;driver&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;browser&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;window_handles&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;last&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This code grabs the browser object and calls switch_to window on it and passes in the last opened window.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now all we need to do is wrap this in a step so we can use it in our scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ruby&quot;&gt;When &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;^&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token constant&quot;&gt;I&lt;/span&gt; access the &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; tab$&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;do&lt;/span&gt;
  page&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;driver&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;browser&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;switch_to&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;window&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;page&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;driver&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;browser&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;window_handles&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;last&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Caveat&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will only work if you are using &lt;a href=&quot;http://seleniumhq.org/docs/&quot;&gt;selenium-webdriver&lt;/a&gt;. It will &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/thoughtbot/capybara-webkit/issues/47&quot;&gt;not work with capybara-webkit&lt;/a&gt; unfortunately. So I switched to selenium, but I told it to use chrome instead of the default firefox and it still works great!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ruby&quot;&gt;Capybara&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;javascript_driver &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token symbol&quot;&gt;:selenium&lt;/span&gt;
Capybara&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;register_driver &lt;span class=&quot;token symbol&quot;&gt;:selenium&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;do&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;app&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;
  Capybara&lt;span class=&quot;token double-colon punctuation&quot;&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;Selenium&lt;span class=&quot;token double-colon punctuation&quot;&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;Driver&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;app&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token symbol&quot;&gt;:browser&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token symbol&quot;&gt;:chrome&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Finale&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now its time to see the step in action. Notice I had to tag the feature with @javascript so that it uses the selenium webdriver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token variable&quot;&gt;@javascript&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token symbol&quot;&gt;Feature&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; Open a discussion

  &lt;span class=&quot;token symbol&quot;&gt;Scenario&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; staff opens a discussion with the mouse
    Given the following users exist&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; username   &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; email                 &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; test&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;user  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; integration&lt;span class=&quot;token variable&quot;&gt;@test&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;com  &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;
    And &lt;span class=&quot;token constant&quot;&gt;I&lt;/span&gt; am on the triage page
    When &lt;span class=&quot;token constant&quot;&gt;I&lt;/span&gt; follow &lt;span class=&quot;token string-literal&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;Can&#39;t get git running on my mac&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    And &lt;span class=&quot;token constant&quot;&gt;I&lt;/span&gt; access the &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; tab
    Then &lt;span class=&quot;token constant&quot;&gt;I&lt;/span&gt; should be on the discussion page &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string-literal&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;5786909&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    And &lt;span class=&quot;token constant&quot;&gt;I&lt;/span&gt; should see &lt;span class=&quot;token string-literal&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;Can&#39;t get git running on my mac&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The link that I follow opens the new page in a new tab, I select the new tab, then run my expectations against it.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Being acquired doesn&#39;t have to suck</title>
    <link href="https://jonmagic.com/posts/being-acquired-doesnt-have-to-suck/"/>
    <updated>2012-01-08T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://jonmagic.com/posts/being-acquired-doesnt-have-to-suck/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It has been a month since &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/blog/993-ordered-list-is-a-githubber&quot;&gt;Ordered List was acquired by GitHub&lt;/a&gt; and our team of 5 joined their team of 50, and it hasn‚Äôt sucked at all. Here are some observations on how to remove the suck from acquisitions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Suck&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My general attitude towards acquisitions the past few years has been fairly negative. I‚Äôve seen too many people and products we love be acquired and the people only stick around until their stock vests and the products are shut down or perverted into something hideous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With all that negative sentiment you would think I would have fought for Ordered List to remain independent, but I assure you everyone on our team was not only on board with the acquisition but also excited about the opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The number one problem after an acquisition are differences in culture. From how the individuals and teams work, to how they interact, how they are led, and how they are motivated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We would not have even considered joining GitHub if there were large differences in culture and any company looking at an acquisition should make sure this is the first thing they research and consider.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Reality&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both sides in this acquisition did their homework and didn‚Äôt just jump in without lots of serious consideration. Putting in this work ahead of time has made the actual integration of our teams virtually frictionless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My day to day work has not changed and yours shouldn‚Äôt have to either. This is definitely something to think about before an acquisition. Do they know what you do best and will they give you the opportunity to continue doing it? Thankfully I‚Äôm still working on the products I love and now I have a pool of talent and knowledge 10x greater than before to draw from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is definitely more to keep track of since there are more people, more products, and just more going on in general, but the time I spend on that is a lot less than the time I used to spend on client work to make sure my salary got paid. Acquisitions can and should give you more opportunities to concentrate on what you are passionate about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, it‚Äôs only been a month, how can I be sure this acquisition won‚Äôt suck? I feel like I‚Äôve been working with these people for a long time, and in a way I have. I have been hanging out with them at conferences, working on open source code with them, and having conversations with them on Twitter for much longer than I‚Äôve been their coworker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the tech industry we have and should take advantage of those opportunities. We can follow and get to know people through their code (a great way to use &lt;a href=&quot;http://github.com/&quot;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;!) as well as on social networks and at conferences. Do your best to know the people you are getting into bed with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My attitude towards acquisitions has definitely changed, but only because it‚Äôs clearer to me what works and what doesn‚Äôt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Avoid merging teams with drastically different cultures, understand the strengths and weaknesses of the teams on both sides and be committed to letting them do what they do best, and know the actual people you will share the future with.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Assimilating Contributed Code</title>
    <link href="https://jonmagic.com/posts/assimilating-contributed-code/"/>
    <updated>2011-12-30T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://jonmagic.com/posts/assimilating-contributed-code/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This year I authored several RubyGems and just this week finally learned how to work with a contributor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UPDATE:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/bryckbost&quot;&gt;@bryckbost&lt;/a&gt; points out that the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/defunkt/github-gem&quot;&gt;github-gem&lt;/a&gt; does exactly what I wanted to do. See the &lt;strong&gt;Fetching and Evaluating Downstream Changes&lt;/strong&gt; section of the README.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course &lt;a href=&quot;http://github.com/&quot;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt; has the great &lt;strong&gt;Merge pull request&lt;/strong&gt; option when an auto-merge is possible, and I use that quite often, but the workflow on OSS projects sometimes requires you to run the tests locally and make any modifications before merging it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A quick search didn‚Äôt turn up any easy to read instructions, and I‚Äôm no git guru, so it took me a few minutes to figure out a simple workflow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is how I checked out, tested, modified, and merged a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jonmagic/ghee/pull/1&quot;&gt;massive pull request&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=&quot;http://github.com/jonmagic/ghee&quot;&gt;Ghee&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rauhryan&quot;&gt;Ryan Rauh&lt;/a&gt; this week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;1. Clone my repo and create a feature branch&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;git&lt;/span&gt; clone git@github.com:jonmagic/ghee.git
&lt;span class=&quot;token builtin class-name&quot;&gt;cd&lt;/span&gt; ghee
&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;git&lt;/span&gt; checkout &lt;span class=&quot;token parameter variable&quot;&gt;-b&lt;/span&gt; repos_support master&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This creates a new branch called &lt;code&gt;repos_support&lt;/code&gt;, based off of &lt;code&gt;master&lt;/code&gt;, and checks it out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2. Pull contributors code into your local branch&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;git&lt;/span&gt; pull https://github.com/rauhryan/ghee.git repos_support&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This pulls the &lt;code&gt;repos_support&lt;/code&gt; branch from the remote repo and merges it into the branch you have checked out (which we also called &lt;code&gt;repos_support&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;3. Run tests, make modifications, commit changes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;bundle &lt;span class=&quot;token builtin class-name&quot;&gt;exec&lt;/span&gt; rake
&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;touch&lt;/span&gt; OHNOES.txt
&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;git&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;add&lt;/span&gt; OHNOES.txt
&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;git&lt;/span&gt; commit &lt;span class=&quot;token parameter variable&quot;&gt;-m&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;Added OHNOES&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;4. Checkout master, merge feature branch, push&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;git&lt;/span&gt; checkout master
&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;git&lt;/span&gt; merge repos_support
&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;git&lt;/span&gt; push&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This workflow follows the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle&quot;&gt;kiss principle&lt;/a&gt;, so it worked quite well for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Please give me feedback.&lt;/strong&gt; I would love to hear about how other people accomplish this task, so I encourage you to leave links/tips/tricks in the comments below.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twelve (gauge)</title>
    <link href="https://jonmagic.com/posts/twelve-gauge/"/>
    <updated>2011-12-09T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://jonmagic.com/posts/twelve-gauge/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Today I hacked together an easy to use gem for accessing the &lt;a href=&quot;http://get.gaug.es/&quot;&gt;Gauges&lt;/a&gt; API.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I started this morning 12-gauge was the first thing I thought, so I called the gem Twelve (silly I know).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had fun figuring out the API (with a little help from &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/bkeepers&quot;&gt;Brandon&lt;/a&gt;) and then writing the gem using some of the proxy object and method missing stuff I was learning a few weeks ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Installation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;gem &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;install&lt;/span&gt; twelve&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Usage&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Get the client ready:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ruby&quot;&gt;access_token &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string-literal&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;abcd1234&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
bfg &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;Twelve&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;access_token&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Request your Gauges info:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ruby&quot;&gt;bfg&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;me&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me I got this back:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-json&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-json&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;name&quot;&lt;/span&gt;=&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;Jonathan Hoyt&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;urls&quot;&lt;/span&gt;=&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;self&quot;&lt;/span&gt;=&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;https://secure.gaug.es/me&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;gauges&quot;&lt;/span&gt;=&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;https://secure.gaug.es/gauges&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;clients&quot;&lt;/span&gt;=&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;https://secure.gaug.es/clients&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;id&quot;&lt;/span&gt;=&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;...&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;last_name&quot;&lt;/span&gt;=&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;Hoyt&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;first_name&quot;&lt;/span&gt;=&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;Jonathan&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;email&quot;&lt;/span&gt;=&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;jonmagic@gmail.com&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next try these:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ruby&quot;&gt;bfg&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;clients
bfg&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;gauges&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;More Documentation and Examples&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs a full-fledged client, so you can create, update, and delete gauges as well as see all the different types of information available on a gauge. See the docs on &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jonmagic/twelve&quot;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Today the whole crew from Ordered List joins GitHub!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Ordered List&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year was a &lt;a href=&quot;https://jonmagic.com/blog/archives/2010/11/18/hey-mom-i-got-a-job/&quot;&gt;big year for myself&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://orderedlist.com/&quot;&gt;Ordered List&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/orderedlist&quot;&gt;Steve&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jnunemaker&quot;&gt;John&lt;/a&gt; launched &lt;a href=&quot;http://get.harmonyapp.com/&quot;&gt;Harmony&lt;/a&gt; in August, I started hanging out with them on a regular basis and &lt;a href=&quot;https://jonmagic.com/blog/archives/2011/10/03/the-history-of-speaker-deck/&quot;&gt;began work&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&quot;http://speakerdeck.com/&quot;&gt;Speaker Deck&lt;/a&gt;, and the end of the year saw &lt;a href=&quot;http://opensoul.org/&quot;&gt;Brandon Keepers&lt;/a&gt; and I leaving our &lt;a href=&quot;http://collectiveidea.com/&quot;&gt;own&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://sabretechllc.com/&quot;&gt;businesses&lt;/a&gt; to make OL &lt;a href=&quot;http://orderedlist.com/blog/articles/four/&quot;&gt;four strong&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year was even bigger, launching &lt;a href=&quot;http://get.gaug.es/&quot;&gt;Gauges&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://jonmagic.com/blog/archives/2011/10/10/launching-speaker-deck/&quot;&gt;Speaker Deck&lt;/a&gt;, adding &lt;a href=&quot;http://orderedlist.com/blog/articles/welcome-matt-graham/&quot;&gt;Matt Graham&lt;/a&gt; to the team, and beginning the journey of learning &lt;a href=&quot;https://jonmagic.com/blog/archives/2011/03/02/new-guy-blues/&quot;&gt;how&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;https://jonmagic.com/blog/archives/2011/03/03/share-the-dream/&quot;&gt;work&lt;/a&gt; as a &lt;a href=&quot;https://jonmagic.com/blog/archives/2011/11/29/how-we-work/&quot;&gt;cohesive unit&lt;/a&gt;. While we learned each others strengths and weaknesses I began my own &lt;a href=&quot;https://jonmagic.com/blog/archives/2011/10/20/mentors/&quot;&gt;journey&lt;/a&gt; of becoming a full-time programmer that could not only contribute to the growth of our company, but also lead in certain circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all dreamed of taking over the world, and we knew we could do it together. We also know it takes time to build something great and that as time goes on new opportunities present themselves. Every once in awhile those opportunities get you even more excited than the dream you are currently living. One year (minus a day) after I joined Ordered List our entire team has accepted the opportunity to join &lt;a href=&quot;http://github.com/&quot;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;GitHub&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/about#company_description&quot;&gt;This company&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/about#the_team&quot;&gt;team behind it&lt;/a&gt; has been near and dear to our hearts for years. I had the chance to meet and hang out with a &lt;a href=&quot;http://zachholman.com/&quot;&gt;few&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://timclem.wordpress.com/&quot;&gt;GitHubbers&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/mtodd&quot;&gt;over&lt;/a&gt; the last year and have really come to appreciate them as &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/mtodd&quot;&gt;programmers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://tom.preston-werner.com/2011/03/29/ten-lessons-from-githubs-first-year.html&quot;&gt;professionals&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://zachholman.com/posts/customer-support-doesnt-have-to-suck/&quot;&gt;writers&lt;/a&gt;, and people. When they started &lt;a href=&quot;http://speakerdeck.com/u/holman/p/how-github-uses-github-to-build-github&quot;&gt;talking&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://speakerdeck.com/u/schacon/p/robots-beer-and-maslow&quot;&gt;about&lt;/a&gt; their &lt;a href=&quot;http://speakerdeck.com/u/mojombo/p/optimizing-for-happiness&quot;&gt;culture&lt;/a&gt; at conferences I marveled even more, excited about how they were &lt;a href=&quot;http://speakerdeck.com/u/schacon/p/robots-beer-and-maslow?slide=79&quot;&gt;changing the rules&lt;/a&gt;, hiring &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;amp;rls=en&amp;amp;q=site:github.com/blog+is+a+GitHubber&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;amp;oe=UTF-8&quot;&gt;tons of awesome people&lt;/a&gt;, and just &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/blog/936-one-million&quot;&gt;kicking-butt&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the opportunity to join GitHub materialized it sparked an epic discussion about the possibilities. It made sense in so many ways, but whenever you entertain the chance to change course you can‚Äôt help but wonder how far you can get on your current trajectory. There were a lot of factors to consider and in the end Steve and John decided that our personal and collective futures with GitHub seemed greater.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the past few weeks the details were hammered out and during that time we‚Äôve each had a chance to reset our dreams for the future, while trying to &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/michigangraham/status/142695650084139008&quot;&gt;keep&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/holman/status/142696256022659072&quot;&gt;the&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/michigangraham/status/143443710292672512&quot;&gt;whole&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/holman/status/143444127403618304&quot;&gt;thing&lt;/a&gt; a secret.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Future&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right now I have no idea what the future holds, except that it is going to be great. I am most excited about the journey, learning new things, powering thru the hard times, accelerating during the good times, and building something that we can all be proud of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks again to everyone involved in making this a reality. Watch out world.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Finish Weekend</title>
    <link href="https://jonmagic.com/posts/finish-weekend/"/>
    <updated>2011-11-12T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://jonmagic.com/posts/finish-weekend/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;While I initially had issues with the concept of Finish Weekend, I‚Äôm really glad I participated and believe everyone involved is better off for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Who&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My friends at &lt;a href=&quot;http://collectiveidea.com/&quot;&gt;Collective Idea&lt;/a&gt; have apparently been talking about doing a &lt;a href=&quot;http://finishweekend.com/&quot;&gt;Finish Weekend&lt;/a&gt; for a few years and this is the year they made it happen! They put out the word thru Twitter, friends, colleagues, and a ton of people signed up and showed up!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I met folks from Detroit, Chicago, South Bend, and even as far away as California! There were programmers, designers, editors, math geeks, marketers, and testers just to name a few.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Why&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finish Weekend was born out of a personal and professional frustration with starting things and never finishing them. What if there was a weekend dedicated to taking something you‚Äôve started, never found time to finish, and actually finish it. Even better, what if there were people around to help you finish it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many folks showed up with projects to finish, but what really surprised me were how many people showed up to help other people finish! This brings us to my issue with Finish Weekend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;My Issue&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When first told about Finish Weekend immediately I reacted negatively because I believe we should be working hard to finish things every day. I love finishing things. Finishing projects is hard (that last 5% can be excruciating) but the joy you get from shipping feature X, or accomplishing goal Y, is greater than the joy I personally get from starting a project (as much fun as that is).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I finally got over myself and realized that Collective Idea was trying to help people learn how to finish things I signed up and made the trek to Holland, Michigan. I did not regret it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Outcome&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I saw a great group of people with greatly varying skillsets and backgrounds come together with one purpose, to finish things. We had people building video based web apps, crazy poetry recombinators, iPhone apps, and even a bond trader learning Python to automate a process that has taken him 1.5 hours every work evening for the last two years in Excel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was able to teach basic programming concepts, performance measuring and optimization, even cut up a mockup into HTML/CSS, and paired with my coworker on some tech that will hopefully help power our products into the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Collective Idea nailed it with Finish Weekend and my hope and desire is that we take the relationships and spirit of pitching in together to accomplish big and small things and carry it into the rest of our lives and not relegate it to a weekend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course we‚Äôll need reminded every so often. See you at the next Finish Weekend üòÉ&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Links&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;

    <title>hubot Scripts Explained</title>
    <link href="https://jonmagic.com/posts/hubot-scripts-explained/"/>
    <updated>2011-10-28T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://jonmagic.com/posts/hubot-scripts-explained/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Ok, so now you‚Äôve got your shiny new hubot up and ready to listen to your every command. But what should we tell him to do with our nonsense!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Basics&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scripts for &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/github/hubot&quot;&gt;hubot&lt;/a&gt; are written with &lt;a href=&quot;http://jashkenas.github.com/coffee-script/&quot;&gt;CoffeeScript&lt;/a&gt;. This is what a basic script looks like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-coffeescript&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-coffeescript&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;# hubot greeting.&lt;/span&gt;
#
&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;# (hi|hello) - say hi to your butler&lt;/span&gt;

module&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;exports &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;robot&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  robot&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;respond &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;hi&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;hello&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;i&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;msg&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    msg&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;send &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;Howdy!&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lets break this script down. The first line is just a description of the script. The third line tells hubot what to include in the help (when you ask hubot for help).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The actual code starts on the module.exports line. Every script you make will start with that line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-coffeescript&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-coffeescript&quot;&gt;module&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;exports &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;robot&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next line tells hubot to respond to hi and hello.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-coffeescript&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-coffeescript&quot;&gt;robot&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;respond &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;hi&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;hello&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;i&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;msg&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It uses a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression&quot;&gt;regular expression&lt;/a&gt; to parse the text, looking for the words hi and hello. The i after the last slash tells the regular expression to not be case sensitive, so it will also match Hi and Hello.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like to use &lt;a href=&quot;http://rubular.com/&quot;&gt;rubular&lt;/a&gt; for writing and testing regular expressions. Its quick, easy to use, and while javascript regular expressions aren‚Äôt exactly like ruby regular expressions I haven‚Äôt run into any inconsistencies yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally we tell hubot to take the message and send a message back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-coffeescript&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-coffeescript&quot;&gt;msg&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;send &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;Howdy!&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Respond vs Hear&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn‚Äôt discover this at first and thought that hubot only responded to commands directed at him, but then I discovered robot.hear! Whereas robot.respond only matches messages directed at hubot, robot.hear will run your regular expression against any chat message!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-coffeescript&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-coffeescript&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;# Hubot has an attitude&lt;/span&gt;

module&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;exports &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;robot&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  robot&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;hear &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;tired&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;too hard&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;to hard&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;upset&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;bored&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;i&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;msg&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    msg&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;send &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;Panzy&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See what I did there üòÉ Any time someone in our chat room says they are tired, that something is too hard, upset, or bored, hubot tells them they‚Äôre a panzy. Oh yeah. This robot butler has an attitude.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Random&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I saw this used first in the shipit script, which displays a random shipit squirrel for your viewing pleasure whenever someone says the words ‚Äúship it‚Äù in your chat room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-coffeescript&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-coffeescript&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;# Rodent Motivation&lt;/span&gt;
#
&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;# ship it - Display a motivation squirrel&lt;/span&gt;
#

squirrels &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;/images/posts/hubot-scripts-explained/20100714-d6q52xajfh4cimxr3888yb77ru.jpg&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;/images/posts/hubot-scripts-explained/20111026-r2wsngtu4jftwxmsytdke6arwd.png&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;/images/posts/hubot-scripts-explained/Screen_Shot_2011-10-27_at_9.36.45_AM.png&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;/images/posts/hubot-scripts-explained/squirrel.png&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;

module&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;exports &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;robot&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  robot&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;hear &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;ship it&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;i&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;msg&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    msg&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;send msg&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;random squirrels&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notice the array that we create with 4 different shipit squirrel images. Then notice this line:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-coffeescript&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-coffeescript&quot;&gt;msg&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;send msg&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;random squirrels&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The msg object has a random method on it which we can pass an array and it will pick a random item from that array! Super handy to keep things from getting repetitive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far we‚Äôve only talked about how to make hubot listen and respond in various ways. Hubot really starts to get interesting when we empower him to go out and do our bidding in the larger world though. This is where hubot really starts to become powerful!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This script is doing quite a bit so we‚Äôll dissect it line by line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-coffeescript&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-coffeescript&quot;&gt;robot&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;respond &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;gem &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;whois&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;i&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;msg&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This tells hubot to look for messages directed at him that have the words ‚Äúgem whois‚Äù and then some string.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-coffeescript&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-coffeescript&quot;&gt;gemname &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;escape&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;msg&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;match&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I grab the gemname from the regular expression. msg.match with an integer will match the captured item from the regular expression. You use parenthesis to capture strings in regular expressions, and they get numbered left to right by however many there are. In this case its the first one, so we pass 1 to msg.match and then assign it off to our variable gemname.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-coffeescript&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-coffeescript&quot;&gt;msg&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;http&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;http://rubygems.org/api/v1/gems/&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation variable&quot;&gt;#{gemname}&lt;/span&gt;.json&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next we tell the msg.http object to use this url, with the gemname interpolated in it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-coffeescript&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-coffeescript&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;err&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; res&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; body&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The .get() function kicks off the request and returns 3 objects, err, res, and body. In this case we‚Äôre only interested in body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-coffeescript&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-coffeescript&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;try&lt;/span&gt;
  json &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token constant&quot;&gt;JSON&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;parse&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;body&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  msg&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;send &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;   gem name: &lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation variable&quot;&gt;#{json.name}&lt;/span&gt;&#92;n&#92;
    owners: &lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation variable&quot;&gt;#{json.authors}&lt;/span&gt;&#92;n&#92;
    info: &lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation variable&quot;&gt;#{json.info}&lt;/span&gt;&#92;n&#92;
    version: &lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation variable&quot;&gt;#{json.version}&lt;/span&gt;&#92;n&#92;
    downloads: &lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation variable&quot;&gt;#{json.downloads}&lt;/span&gt;&#92;n&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;catch&lt;/span&gt; error
  msg&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;send &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;Gem not found. It will be mine. Oh yes. It will be mine. *sinister laugh*&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If JSON.parse is able to parse the body then it displays the gem information, if it errors we get the ‚ÄúGem not found‚Äù message.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Advanced HTTP&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if you want to hit an API that requires authentication? Here is a script that uses http basic auth when hitting the &lt;a href=&quot;http://dnsimple.com/&quot;&gt;dnsimple&lt;/a&gt; api to check domain name availability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-coffeescript&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-coffeescript&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;# Domain availability via DNSimple, requires you set&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;# DNSIMPLE_USERNAME &amp;amp; DNSIMPLE_PASSWORD environment variables&lt;/span&gt;
#
&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;# check domain &amp;lt;domainname&gt; - returns whether a domain is available&lt;/span&gt;
#

module&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;exports &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;robot&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  robot&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;hear &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;check &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;domain&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;i&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;msg&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

      &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;err&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; res&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; body&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;switch&lt;/span&gt; res&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;statusCode
          &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;when&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;200&lt;/span&gt;
            msg&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;send &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;Sorry, &lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation variable&quot;&gt;#{domain}&lt;/span&gt; is not available.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;when&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;404&lt;/span&gt;
            msg&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;send &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;Cybersquat that s***!&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;when&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;401&lt;/span&gt;
            msg&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;send &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;You need to authenticate by setting the DNSIMPLE_USERNAME &amp;amp; DNSIMPLE_PASSWORD environment variables&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;else&lt;/span&gt;
            msg&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;send &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;Unable to process your request and we&#39;re not sure why :(&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We do the same thing as the last example, grabbing the domain name that is captured by the regular expression, but then things get a bit different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-coffeescript&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-coffeescript&quot;&gt;user &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; process&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;env&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token constant&quot;&gt;DNSIMPLE_USERNAME&lt;/span&gt;
pass &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; process&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;env&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token constant&quot;&gt;DNSIMPLE_PASSWORD&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here we grab some environment variables and assign them to variables. If you are &lt;a href=&quot;http://jonmagic.com/blog/archives/2011/10/28/hipchat-hubot-and-me/&quot;&gt;deploying hubot to Heroku&lt;/a&gt; then setting environment variables is crazy easy:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-coffeescript&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-coffeescript&quot;&gt;heroku &lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;config&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;add &lt;span class=&quot;token constant&quot;&gt;DNSIMPLE_USERNAME&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;john&lt;span class=&quot;token class-member variable&quot;&gt;@doe&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;com &lt;span class=&quot;token constant&quot;&gt;DNSIMPLE_PASSWORD&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;4w3s0m3p4ssw0rd&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next we have to create the auth string that we‚Äôll stuff into the authorization header.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-coffeescript&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-coffeescript&quot;&gt;auth &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&#39;Basic &#39;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;Buffer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;user &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&#39;:&#39;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; pass&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;toString&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&#39;base64&#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creating that auth string is some javascript voodoo that took me awhile to figure out, finally finding an article on &lt;a href=&quot;http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3905126/how-to-use-http-client-in-node-js-if-there-are-basic-authorization&quot;&gt;stackoverflow&lt;/a&gt; that had the magic I needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-coffeescript&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-coffeescript&quot;&gt;msg&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;http&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;https://dnsimple.com/domains/&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation variable&quot;&gt;#{domain}&lt;/span&gt;/check&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;headers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;Authorization&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; auth&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;Accept&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&#39;application/json&#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;err&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; res&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; body&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The really interesting line in the code above is the .headers() line. We can set headers for the http request before calling .get(), allowing us to configure the Authorization and Accept headers! Now the last bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-coffeescript&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-coffeescript&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;switch&lt;/span&gt; res&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;statusCode
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;when&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;200&lt;/span&gt;
    msg&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;send &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;Sorry, &lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation variable&quot;&gt;#{domain}&lt;/span&gt; is not available.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;when&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;404&lt;/span&gt;
    msg&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;send &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;Cybersquat that s***!&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;when&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;401&lt;/span&gt;
    msg&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;send &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;You need to authenticate by setting the DNSIMPLE_USERNAME &amp;amp; DNSIMPLE_PASSWORD environment variables&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;else&lt;/span&gt;
    msg&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;send &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;Unable to process your request and we&#39;re not sure why :(&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The response (res) object has a statusCode method on it which we can use to match http response codes. Based on the dnsimple api I was able to make a simple switch statement with the correct replies for each status code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope this is helpful to some folks out there. I can‚Äôt wait to see what other hubot scripts people write!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make sure to fork the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/github/hubot-scripts&quot;&gt;hubot-scripts&lt;/a&gt; repo, add your scripts, and do a pull request once you‚Äôve got them working. The gem whois and dnsimple scripts above have already been accepted into the hubot-scripts library!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enjoy üòÉ&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>HipChat, hubot, and Me</title>
    <link href="https://jonmagic.com/posts/hipchat-hubot-and-me/"/>
    <updated>2011-10-28T00:00:00Z</updated>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;How you can give Siri her very own robot brother with some help from Heroku and HipChat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Github released &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/github/hubot&quot;&gt;hubot&lt;/a&gt; this week and geeks the world over have been transfixed by his awesomeness. He‚Äôs the second robot butler to enter my life lately, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apple.com/iphone/features/siri.html&quot;&gt;Siri&lt;/a&gt; being the first. Together these two fulfill my every wish (not quite) and are at my beck and call day and night (too true).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UPDATE: for a slightly different take &lt;a href=&quot;http://martinciu.com/2011/11/deploying-hubot-to-heroku-like-a-boss.html&quot;&gt;try these instructions by @martinciu&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NOTE: to learn more about writing hubot scripts &lt;a href=&quot;http://jonmagic.com/blog/archives/2011/10/28/hubot-scripts-explained/&quot;&gt;read this&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Getting Started&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first step is to head on over to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/github/hubot/downloads&quot;&gt;hubot downloads&lt;/a&gt; to grab yourself a copy of the latest hubot tarball. Download it and then open your command line to your download folder. It looked something like this for me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token builtin class-name&quot;&gt;cd&lt;/span&gt; Downloads
&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;tar&lt;/span&gt; zxvf hubot-1.1.3.tar.gz
&lt;span class=&quot;token builtin class-name&quot;&gt;cd&lt;/span&gt; hubot&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make sure you have node.js and npm installed. I used &lt;a href=&quot;http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/&quot;&gt;homebrew&lt;/a&gt; to accomplish this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;brew &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;install&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;node&lt;/span&gt;
brew &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;install&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;npm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then you can just run the hubot binary and it should install all the necessary packages and fire right up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;bin/hubot&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you run into any issues at this point please consult the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/github/hubot/issues&quot;&gt;hubot Issues&lt;/a&gt; page on Github, because someone has probably already run into the issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Configuring Heroku and HipChat&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First we need to initialize git for our hubot so he‚Äôs actually stored in version control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;git&lt;/span&gt; init &lt;span class=&quot;token builtin class-name&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;git&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;add&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token builtin class-name&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;git&lt;/span&gt; commit &lt;span class=&quot;token parameter variable&quot;&gt;-m&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;spawning my first robot!&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next we create a new instance on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/cedar&quot;&gt;Heroku cedar stack&lt;/a&gt; (assuming you already are &lt;a href=&quot;http://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/quickstart&quot;&gt;setup to use Heroku&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;heroku create my_hubot_app_name &lt;span class=&quot;token parameter variable&quot;&gt;--stack&lt;/span&gt; cedar&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then we need to setup hubot and Heroku to connect to our &lt;a href=&quot;http://hipchat.com/&quot;&gt;HipChat&lt;/a&gt; account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This requires creating the user in HipChat and then going to your account page in HipChat (&lt;a href=&quot;https://mycompanyhere.hipchat.com/account/xmpp&quot;&gt;https://mycompanyhere.hipchat.com/account/xmpp&lt;/a&gt;) to get some values that we‚Äôll need for configuring Heroku.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You‚Äôll also need to go to the Group Admin in HipChat and the API tab to create an API Auth Token. Run the following commands replacing the values with the ones that match in the HipChat settings:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;heroku config:add &lt;span class=&quot;token assign-left variable&quot;&gt;HUBOT_HIPCHAT_JID&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;Username&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

heroku config:add &lt;span class=&quot;token assign-left variable&quot;&gt;HUBOT_HIPCHAT_NAME&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;Room nickname&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;# example: heroku config:add HUBOT_HIPCHAT_NAME=&quot;Geoffrey Butler&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

heroku config:add &lt;span class=&quot;token assign-left variable&quot;&gt;HUBOT_HIPCHAT_PASSWORD&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;Password you created &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; hubots user&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
heroku config:add &lt;span class=&quot;token assign-left variable&quot;&gt;HUBOT_HIPCHAT_TOKEN&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;Token from Group Admin and API&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also need to add the RedisToGo addon. (Thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;http://profitably.com/&quot;&gt;Graham Siener&lt;/a&gt; for pointing this out)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;heroku addons:add redistogo:nano&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that Heroku is configured we need to slightly modify our Procfile to use the right adapter and name. Mine looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;app: bin/hubot &lt;span class=&quot;token parameter variable&quot;&gt;-a&lt;/span&gt; hipchat &lt;span class=&quot;token parameter variable&quot;&gt;-n&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;Geoffrey Butler&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Replace Geoffrey Butler with whatever you named the user in HipChat. This should exactly match the Room nickname we set above. Once you‚Äôve updated the Procfile and saved it we need to commit it with git.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;git&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;add&lt;/span&gt; Procfile
&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;git&lt;/span&gt; commit &lt;span class=&quot;token parameter variable&quot;&gt;-m&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;updated Procfile to use hipchat adapter and hipchat room nickname&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Deploying to Heroku&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we should be ready to deploy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;git push heroku master
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This step failed for me at first. I had to edit package.json and change the dependencies section to look like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-json&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-json&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;&quot;dependencies&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;&quot;hubot&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;1.1.0&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;&quot;hubot-scripts&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;1.1.0&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token property&quot;&gt;&quot;optparse&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;1.0.1&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The latest version of hubot-scripts blows up on the Heroku Cedar stack unfortunately. So after this step I committed my changes one more time and deployed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;git&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;add&lt;/span&gt; package.json
&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;git&lt;/span&gt; commit &lt;span class=&quot;token parameter variable&quot;&gt;-m&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;changed dependencies&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;git&lt;/span&gt; push heroku master&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Woot! It worked! Now that its deployed we just need to start it up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;heroku ps:scale &lt;span class=&quot;token assign-left variable&quot;&gt;app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inside our HipChat rooms Geoffrey suddenly appeared and I was able to talk to him.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Mentors</title>
    <link href="https://jonmagic.com/posts/mentors/"/>
    <updated>2011-10-20T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://jonmagic.com/posts/mentors/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We need more mentors. Mentors help us avoid mistakes and give us guidance on how to be better at our jobs and at life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;My Mentors&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first eight months of my new job at &lt;a href=&quot;http://orderedlist.com/&quot;&gt;Ordered List&lt;/a&gt; I paired with my coworker &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/bkeepers&quot;&gt;Brandon&lt;/a&gt; three or four days a week. We kept each other on task, but most important for me, he started teaching me the process of writing beautiful and maintainable code. He had years of experience in this industry and a passion for elegant solutions that I didn‚Äôt have, but I could learn from him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we aren‚Äôt pairing as often now, Brandon and I have built a level of trust that enables us to quickly and easily share ideas and continue to educate each other and make better software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the last couple months my coworker/boss &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/jnunemaker&quot;&gt;John&lt;/a&gt; has been mentoring me. We meet once a week, either over breakfast, lunch, or just a hot chocolate, and have a nice long chat. We usually cover things we‚Äôve been thinking about the past week, what to focus on in the next week or month, personal goals, even our personal lives. This too has been invaluable for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why Mentors Matter&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my time with both Brandon and John I‚Äôve been able to get someone else‚Äôs perspective on how I‚Äôm progressing as both a programmer and a person. Looking back I‚Äôm completely shocked by how much I‚Äôve changed for the better thanks to them taking the time to care about me and give me feedback that I can act on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By listening to their advice, which has years of experience and thought behind it, I am able to set a better course for my own life. A good mentor shares what has worked and what has not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Finding A Mentor&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have the opportunity to be mentored right now, by someone you respect, seize it. Good mentors are few and far between in my experience. In my current situation I didn‚Äôt have to go seeking a mentor, they came to me and offered to help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past I have had to seek out mentors. I wouldn‚Äôt be working at Ordered List if I hadn‚Äôt reached out four years ago, initially seeking like minded geeks, but eventually finding &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/orderedlist&quot;&gt;Steve&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/jnunemaker&quot;&gt;John&lt;/a&gt; and growing to respect them, so much so that I took advantage of every opportunity to hang out and learn from them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Final Thoughts&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While having a good mentor can be uplifting, constructive, and life changing, likewise a bad mentor can tear you down. Be careful entering a mentoring relationship to ensure the mentor is someone you have at least some level of trust and respect for. If you leave a meeting challenged and excited, things are probably on the right track. If you leave a meeting discouraged and ready to quit, examine whether its your attitude that is the problem or whether you can‚Äôt trust and respect your mentor enough to learn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One on one time with your mentor is essential, so put it on the calendar and stick to it. If you aren‚Äôt serious enough to make the meeting happen then figure out why you are resistant and fix it. John and I have to reschedule a meeting every so often, but we try to avoid canceling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally I would just like to encourage you to mentor someone yourself, if you are ready. I am not mentoring anyone at the moment, but I have in the past and I will in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need more mentors.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Why Should We Write?</title>
    <link href="https://jonmagic.com/posts/why-should-we-write/"/>
    <updated>2011-10-14T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://jonmagic.com/posts/why-should-we-write/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Building a career as a programmer requires a lot of hard work, determination, and in my opinion a lot of writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do you build a personal brand online? How do you get opportunities to work on awesome projects? How do you get invited to speak at conferences? Looking at my coworkers‚Äô success I would deduce that you have to work hard on stuff you care about and then share the knowledge you have gained with your peers, writing on a &lt;a href=&quot;http://orderedlist.com/blog/&quot;&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://railstips.org/&quot;&gt;for&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://opensoul.org/&quot;&gt;example&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Writing has always been a struggle for me, I was always a math geek, but I cannot use that as an excuse if I want to continually advance my career. If we are working online, building websites, doing design, programming web applications, or working on infrastructure, we need to be writing about our experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We run into new problems every day. More often than not the solution is a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;amp;rls=en&amp;amp;q=what+is+the+answer+to+life+the+universe+and+everything&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;amp;oe=UTF-8&quot;&gt;Google search&lt;/a&gt; away. But when it isn‚Äôt and we find a solution on our own, we should be writing it down and sharing it with the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether it‚Äôs writing &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jonmagic/grim#readme&quot;&gt;readme‚Äôs&lt;/a&gt; for an open source library, &lt;a href=&quot;http://jonmagic.com/blog/archives/2011/10/06/grim-multiprocessor-to-the-rescue/&quot;&gt;blogging&lt;/a&gt; about how you solved a problem, or &lt;a href=&quot;http://jonmagic.com/blog/archives/2011/10/03/just-write-it-down/&quot;&gt;sharing some insight&lt;/a&gt; about how to become a better person, I think we should all be writing more and sharing it with the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let‚Äôs become better communicators thru practice, making the world a better place while at the same time advancing our careers.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Launching Speaker Deck</title>
    <link href="https://jonmagic.com/posts/launching-speaker-deck/"/>
    <updated>2011-10-10T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://jonmagic.com/posts/launching-speaker-deck/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Looking back at the last two weeks since launching Speaker Deck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Launching&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knowing when to launch a product is a painstaking task and ultimately you are never sure if it‚Äôs the right time, but at some point you have to pull the trigger. September 26th &lt;a href=&quot;http://orderedlist.com/the-team/&quot;&gt;we&lt;/a&gt; finally committed and launched &lt;a href=&quot;http://speakerdeck.com/&quot;&gt;Speaker Deck&lt;/a&gt; to the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The past two weeks since launch have been pretty intense, we‚Äôve had over 2500 signups and over 1000 presentations uploaded. We‚Äôve received hundreds of emails, people just telling us how excited they are about Speaker Deck and many of them asking for a feature or requesting help. Seeing everyone‚Äôs reactions has confirmed in our minds that we weren‚Äôt the only ones feeling severe slide hosting pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/#!/search/speakerdeck&quot;&gt;twitter search for speakerdeck&lt;/a&gt; has seen a constant stream of tweets, almost all of them linking directly to specific slide decks, which is awesome!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Fixing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thankfully &lt;a href=&quot;http://heroku.com/&quot;&gt;Heroku&lt;/a&gt; has been a fantastic platform for Speaker Deck so far. During peak traffic we‚Äôve been able to easily scale up both our web capacity (how many requests we can handle from your browsers) and the background worker capacity (where we process your PDFs into individual slides).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No story is complete without some drama though, right? When we opened up signups we almost immediately began seeing presentations that wouldn‚Äôt process. Thankfully within a week we were able to &lt;a href=&quot;http://jonmagic.com/blog/archives/2011/10/06/grim-multiprocessor-to-the-rescue/&quot;&gt;roll out fixes&lt;/a&gt; that got us past this hurdle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also ran into problems with slides acting like they were never processed even though they had. This turned out to be race conditions. In addition, there were issues with caching. There were a couple instances where we cached something and then missed clearing that item from the cache when the item was updated. Hard bugs to track down but easy to fix thankfully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all things went really well, thankfully, since we were all gone to New Orleans for &lt;a href=&quot;http://rubyconf.org/&quot;&gt;RubyConf&lt;/a&gt; and without good internet. Looking back, launching 2 days before a road trip was probably not the wisest thing we‚Äôve ever done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Future&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm betting many of you are thinking ‚Äúhow the heck is this sustainable?‚Äù I‚Äôll let you know when we figure it out. Seriously though, we do have plans to monetize and I‚Äôd like to start talking about them to see what you folks think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first idea is just what we‚Äôre doing right now, mentioning our other products (&lt;a href=&quot;http://get.gaug.es/&quot;&gt;Gauges&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;a href=&quot;http://get.harmonyapp.com/&quot;&gt;Harmony&lt;/a&gt;) in a very small and tasteful way in the sidebar. For this plan to succeed on its own there would have to be a lot of people clicking through and signing up for our other products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second plan is to add pro accounts. We‚Äôve heard a lot of great feedback about bigger features people want, like private presentations that you can share with a select group and also statistics. We‚Äôd love to hear more about features you want, especially the ones you‚Äôd be willing to pay for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We of course still have a lot of core features to build, like search, full screen mode, following presenters, activity streams, and so much more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of us at Ordered List just want to say thanks. It has been a wild ride and we‚Äôve been blown away by how many people are using Speaker Deck and all the good will that has been coming our way. Thank you for making it a success!&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Grim MultiProcessor to the Rescue!</title>
    <link href="https://jonmagic.com/posts/grim-multiprocessor-to-the-rescue/"/>
    <updated>2011-10-06T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://jonmagic.com/posts/grim-multiprocessor-to-the-rescue/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We recently ran into issues with certain versions of GhostScript not being able to convert PDFs into images. Here‚Äôs how we solved the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Problem&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week we launched &lt;a href=&quot;http://speakerdeck.com/&quot;&gt;Speaker Deck&lt;/a&gt; and since launch over 2000 people have signed up and uploaded almost a 1000 presentations. We were using GhostScript 9.04 because it is faster than 9.02 by a factor of two and fixed some processing problems we had experienced converting certain PDFs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;convert: Postscript delegate failed `presentation.pdf&#39;: No such file or directory @ error/pdf.c/ReadPDFImage/663.
convert: missing an image filename `slide.jpg&#39; @ error/convert.c/ConvertImageCommand/3011.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately we ran into the same processing issue with 9.04 and through trial and error figured out that those presentations that wouldn‚Äôt process with 9.04 would process with 9.02. So what to do! GhostScript 9.04 works for most presentations and is faster but fails on certain PDFs where 9.02 actually does work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Solution&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are using &lt;a href=&quot;http://jonmagic.com/blog/archives/2011/09/06/grim/&quot;&gt;Grim&lt;/a&gt; to convert PDFs into images, so I decided that Grim needed to be updated to support multiple processors. Better yet I thought it would be cool if Grim could automatically try multiple processors if you specified more than one, starting with the first and falling back to secondary processors as needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started working on adding Processors to Grim while at &lt;a href=&quot;http://rubyconf.org/&quot;&gt;RubyConf&lt;/a&gt; and Monday finished up getting it all working. I started by pulling out the ImageMagick and GhostScript specific code into an ImageMagickProcessor class that lets you pass in the path to convert and gs (ImageMagick and GhostScript executables).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ruby&quot;&gt;Grim&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;processor &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; Grim&lt;span class=&quot;token double-colon punctuation&quot;&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;ImageMagickProcessor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token symbol&quot;&gt;:imagemagick_path&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string-literal&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;/path/to/convert&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token symbol&quot;&gt;:ghostscript_path&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string-literal&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;/path/to/gs&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once I had that working (super easy thanks to a great test suite!) I started in on the MultiProcessor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The MultiProcessor accepts an array of processors and uses them in order, falling back to secondary processors when the first in line fails. If none of them succeed it just raises the same error the processors on their own raise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ruby&quot;&gt;Grim&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;processor &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; Grim&lt;span class=&quot;token double-colon punctuation&quot;&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;MultiProcessor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
  Grim&lt;span class=&quot;token double-colon punctuation&quot;&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;ImageMagickProcessor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token symbol&quot;&gt;:imagemagick_path&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string-literal&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;/path/to/6.7/convert&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token symbol&quot;&gt;:ghostscript_path&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string-literal&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;/path/to/9.04/gs&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  Grim&lt;span class=&quot;token double-colon punctuation&quot;&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token class-name&quot;&gt;ImageMagickProcessor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token symbol&quot;&gt;:imagemagick_path&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string-literal&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;/path/to/6.6/convert&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token symbol&quot;&gt;:ghostscript_path&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string-literal&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;/path/to/9.02/gs&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monday we deployed &lt;a href=&quot;http://speakerdeck.com/&quot;&gt;Speaker Deck&lt;/a&gt; with the updated Grim gem and reprocessed the 13 presentations that were stuck. Every single one of them processed without a hitch!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Future&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that the actual processing logic has been split out into easy to build Processor classes, I see us building more processors for Grim. Why not a Quartz processor, or a processor that works on Windows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you would like to use Grim in your project or get involved with development just head over to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://github.com/jonmagic/grim&quot;&gt;Grim repo on Github&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Thank You Steve Jobs</title>
    <link href="https://jonmagic.com/posts/thank-you-steve-jobs/"/>
    <updated>2011-10-05T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://jonmagic.com/posts/thank-you-steve-jobs/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;When did you start using a Mac? Just wanted to share my story and how Steve Jobs and Apple changed my life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I bought my first Apple laptop, the 12‚Äù Powerbook, in 2002 for $2000. It forever changed my life. Simple, intuitive, and extremely powerful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before that I had only ever owned PCs, my first one a 286SX my parents bought in 1987. Before that I had played on 8088‚Äôs, playing Frogger and learning a little BASIC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the 90‚Äôs my uncle John would drop off computer parts at my house and I built many computers, even entering a 386SX in the 4H county fair when I was 10. I won every award you could win by default, not many other 10 year olds were entering computers in the 4H. Not sure if they ever have since in Hillsdale, Michigan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember my first experience with an Apple. There was room full of Apple IIe‚Äôs at Kimball Camp in Reading, Michigan. I remember not being impressed, as they were pretty far behind what I was using at the time (486 running Windows 3.1).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then in the mid 90‚Äôs I started using Macs running OS 7 or 8 at Spring Arbor College where my mom went to finish her bachelors. I was impressed even then by the interface, it was just easier to use. But I continued to use PCs for years, becoming a PC technician, and fixing computers and training people how to use them through high school and into college.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then during my junior year of college (2002) I finally drank the kool-aid and switched to a Mac. I had just purchased a brand new HP and was hanging out with my friend Christian (&lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/mintchaos&quot;&gt;@mintchaos&lt;/a&gt;), who had been a Mac user for life, and noticed how much faster and easier to use his white iBook was. I played with it a bit and the next day returned the HP and bought myself a Mac.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first Apple computer was the 12‚Äù PowerBook. It was awesome. OS X, the PowerBook hardware, and the Apple culture became part of who I was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had spent years spending the majority of my time keeping my computers running, keeping my friends, family, and clients‚Äô computers running. Suddenly I found out there was a computer that you could just use to get stuff done, real stuff, like building websites, programming, graphic design, building cool stuff out of photos and video, and the barrier to entry was only a slightly premium price. The learning curve was extremely low, the interface crazy intuitive, and it never crashed!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When clients asked what kind of computer I used I was always excited to tell them about Apple. I would usually say something like, ‚ÄúI fix computers all day everyday, I use an Apple at home because it just works.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fast forward nine years and I am absolutely convinced that Steve Jobs and what he built at Apple were and are the single most important influences on my technological life and career.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am now a software developer, using my Mac and iPhone every day for fun, work, communication, and so much more. I can‚Äôt imagine I would have ever accomplished so much in the last nine years if it weren‚Äôt for Apple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just finished reading &lt;em&gt;iWoz&lt;/em&gt; and I‚Äôm really looking forward to reading Jobs‚Äôs biography.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I owe a debt of gratitude to Steve. My thoughts and prayers go out to his friends and family.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The History of Speaker Deck</title>
    <link href="https://jonmagic.com/posts/the-history-of-speaker-deck/"/>
    <updated>2011-10-03T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://jonmagic.com/posts/the-history-of-speaker-deck/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;How a product was born, from inception to implementation, and distractions to launch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Inception&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://speakerdeck.com/&quot;&gt;Speaker Deck&lt;/a&gt; was born in a little Irish bar right around the corner from our offices in South Bend Indiana in May of&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I was meeting &lt;a href=&quot;http://orderedlist.com/the-team/#steve-smith&quot;&gt;Steve&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://orderedlist.com/the-team/john-nunemaker&quot;&gt;John&lt;/a&gt; for lunch and they were talking about how much they disliked the slide sharing options currently available. It was of special interest to them as they do a lot of public speaking and at the time were teaching classes at &lt;a href=&quot;http://nd.edu/&quot;&gt;Notre Dame&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They were dreaming (as they do) of a better way to share presentations with the world. Something elegant, simple, without all the mess. Then reality hit and they realized they just didn‚Äôt have the time to build it. Life was too busy, family, client work, teaching, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://get.harmonyapp.com/&quot;&gt;Harmony&lt;/a&gt; ate up all their time, there was just no way they could start working on a new product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Implementation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was my opportunity. If I was serious about my dream of becoming a programmer, here was my chance. I said ‚ÄúI‚Äôll do it‚Äù, then cracked open my laptop and started hacking around with ghostscript and imagemagick to see if I could extract images from pdf‚Äôs. An hour later the core tech (&lt;a href=&quot;http://github.com/jonmagic/grim&quot;&gt;now extracted into a rubygem&lt;/a&gt;) behind Speaker Deck was working (in a limited fashion) and a product was born.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;June 1st of 2010 was my first git commit, a basic rails app with an already processed presentation so I had images to use as I created the html and css from Steve‚Äôs initial mockups. It quickly took on a life of its own at that point, Steve implementing an awesome embeddable slide viewer, so nifty we actually use it on Speaker Deck the same exact way you use it when embedding a presentation on your own site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The guys taught me test driven development while building Speaker Deck, and over the summer and into the fall I kept working on it. Initially just Steve and John were using it to host their slides, but then an opportunity arose while at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.10gen.com/events/mongo-chicago-2010&quot;&gt;Mongo Chicago&lt;/a&gt;, and on October 20th of 2010 we had our first beta testers signup and upload presentations!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/johnnunemaker/4609508175/in/photostream/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://jonmagic.com/images/posts/the-history-of-speaker-deck/4609508175_f3bcf70e45_b.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;John presenting at Mongo Chicago 2010&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
(my coworker/boss John presenting at Mongo Chicago 2010)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Good Distractions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almost a year has passed since we started signing up our first beta users and September 26th we launched Speaker Deck to the world! In the past year I ended up going to work for Steve and John and they also hired &lt;a href=&quot;http://orderedlist.com/the-team/#brandon-keepers&quot;&gt;Brandon Keepers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://orderedlist.com/the-team/#matt-graham&quot;&gt;Matt Graham&lt;/a&gt;. In that time our team has been doing a lot of consulting work, making our existing product &lt;a href=&quot;http://get.harmonyapp.com/&quot;&gt;Harmony&lt;/a&gt; better, and we even launched &lt;a href=&quot;http://get.gaug.es/&quot;&gt;Gauges&lt;/a&gt;, a website analytics service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The entire time we were working on these other projects we were formulating what we wanted Speaker Deck to be and this summer that plan started to solidify and we got back to work on it. The first big thing that needed to happen was &lt;a href=&quot;http://jonmagic.com/blog/archives/2011/07/27/moving-speakerdeck-to-heroku/&quot;&gt;moving Speaker Deck to Heroku and S3&lt;/a&gt; for hosting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This transition only took a few days to initially implement but gave us an easy &amp;amp; affordable way to grow the service into the future. Meanwhile Steve went to town on some UI &amp;amp; UX improvements that would help set us apart from the competition even more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Launch&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last month leading up to launch was pretty intense, hammering out final details and deciding that we wanted to release the product to our users as a free service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then on September 26th we launched it at about 3pm EST. That first day we had over 600 signups and hundreds of presentations were uploaded. It was a rush seeing people use it, getting feedback, fixing bugs, and dreaming about the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past week since launch we‚Äôve had many more signups, hundreds more presentations uploaded, and such great feedback that has helped us formulate an even better plan for how to move forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôll be posting more about Speaker Deck later this week, talking about some of the triumphs and struggles we‚Äôve had since launch.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Just Write It Down</title>
    <link href="https://jonmagic.com/posts/just-write-it-down/"/>
    <updated>2011-10-03T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://jonmagic.com/posts/just-write-it-down/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I struggle with remembering great ideas, not so great ideas, things I want to accomplish, and so much more. Let‚Äôs talk about the easiest way to hack our lives so we can be more productive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you find yourself struggling to remember conversations, epiphanies, and just ‚Äúwhat should I do next‚Äù then you may be struggling with the same thing I am, a lousy memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For years I‚Äôve told people my memory is horrible, but for some reason I never actually took action to rectify the situation! Maybe I was lying to myself and saying ‚Äúoh, you‚Äôll remember that‚Äù or maybe I never made the connection that my memory will never get better without being proactive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today that is changing. Actually, this pattern of figuring things out and then forgetting the solution has been going away slowly yet surely for me for a few months now. How you ask?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My coworker John (&lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/jnunemaker&quot;&gt;@jnunemaker&lt;/a&gt;) has been encouraging me since I started working with him to write things down. Keep a small notebook with you at all times, record important points from conversations, ideas you have in the middle of doing other things, any little piece of information that might actually be useful in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apparently I‚Äôm a slow learner as it has taken months to get into the habit of writing things down, but now I‚Äôm seeing real improvements in my memory. I don‚Äôt even have to read over all of the notes I‚Äôve taken to remember things sometimes. Just the act of writing it down in the first place is helping me create long term storage for that information in my brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm working on a lot of little processes in my life to improve my productivity, both at work and at home. Remembering things has been a great first step and I‚Äôve been blessed by the results.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Grim is a simple gem for extracting (reaping) a page from a pdf and converting it to an image as well as extract the text from the page as a string.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jonmagic/grim&quot;&gt;Grim&lt;/a&gt; is my first Ruby gem! Not technically my first OSS contribution, but definitely my first gem. This project came out of &lt;a href=&quot;http://speakerdeck.com/&quot;&gt;Speaker Deck&lt;/a&gt; and is used by Speaker Deck whenever you upload a presentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Sample usage&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ruby&quot;&gt;pdf &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; Grim&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;reap&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string-literal&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;/path/to/pdf&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
count &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; pdf&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;count
pdf&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;save&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string-literal&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&#39;/path/to/image.png&#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
text &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; pdf&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;text

pdf&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;each&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;do&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;page&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;
  puts page&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;text
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This gem is perfect for anyone working with PDF‚Äôs that wants to extract single pages as images or the text from a page using Ruby.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ditch Your Crew</title>
    <link href="https://jonmagic.com/posts/ditch-your-crew/"/>
    <updated>2011-09-03T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://jonmagic.com/posts/ditch-your-crew/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Want to be a better programmer and a better person? Ditch your coworkers, go out and meet other peers, ask questions, and most importantly, listen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What the heck am I talking about? A little back story is in order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rocky Mountain Ruby conference was this last week and I had the opportunity to attend thanks to a ticket I won on twitter (thank you &lt;a href=&quot;http://bittheory.com/&quot;&gt;@bittheory_&lt;/a&gt;) and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://orderedlist.com/&quot;&gt;company I work for&lt;/a&gt; being generous enough to pay most of my way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I attended it without my usual crew and only knew a couple people at the conference, so pretty much as soon as I arrived, making new friends was a necessity. Thankfully I‚Äôm not a shy person, so I set about meeting everyone I possibly could.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not being surrounded by folks I already know and have been learning from the past few years, not being in my comfort zone, gave me the opportunity to start completely new conversations. This is invaluable if we want to keep pushing ourselves to learn and become better people. I learned more during the three days at this conference than I have the last three months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My title and intro were strong words (link bait!) but my point is this. Whether you are out with your coworkers or on your own, be deliberate about getting outside your comfort zone, meeting new people, building new relationships, asking lots of questions, and listening to the answers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will not be disappointed and the world will be a better place for it.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A waiter once taught me</title>
    <link href="https://jonmagic.com/posts/a-waiter-once-taught-me/"/>
    <updated>2011-08-04T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://jonmagic.com/posts/a-waiter-once-taught-me/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;While in San Francisco on our long overdue honeymoon I learned a valuable lesson from our waiter at the Farallon restaurant. While the food was amazing, his confidence and pride in their product was the thing that intrigued me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;People Expect Great Service&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I expect great service anywhere I go, probably because it‚Äôs something I strive for in my vocation. But sometimes people surprise me and most of the time it‚Äôs a good surprise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the hardest customer service jobs I can imagine is serving at a restaurant. I know I couldn‚Äôt do it, having to be courteous every second of every diner‚Äôs meal, remembering every detail of their order, and finding the perfect balance of when to check up on a table and when to leave it alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our server was amazing‚Äîhis timing, menu advice, and interest in our wellbeing set him apart. But the thing I really came away with?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Confidence and Pride&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He had complete confidence, and pride, in the food that they serve. He was glowing with pride when giving recommendations, and absolutely confident that their best was better than anything we could eat anywhere else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not once did he walk up to our table when we were in the middle of a bite, and when he did stop by it wasn‚Äôt to ask ‚Äúis everything ok?‚Äù but rather to ask ‚Äúso what did you think?‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Asking the Wrong Question&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I never realized until then that asking someone ‚Äúis everything ok?‚Äù while they are consuming your product, is just about the worst thing you could ask. Why?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, it prompts a yes or no response, so in that moment they have to decide whether they like or dislike it more. Why give them a chance to form an opinion based on a 50/50 split?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, it conjures this notion that you don‚Äôt have supreme confidence in the product you are selling, that there is the possibility you don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs good enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Asking the Right Question at the Right Time&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, we should be interacting with our customers in a way that shows we are confident in what we are selling and we take pride in the quality of the product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the waiter asked me ‚Äúso what do you think?‚Äù he was requiring me to think about the tastes, the smells, the pairings of ingredients, and I immediately had good thoughts and told him so. In addition, he timed his question so well that it came at a moment where I could stop and think and answer clearly. My mouth wasn‚Äôt full and I wasn‚Äôt distracted by taking a sip of my wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He listened to my answers and agreed and then would often say, ‚Äúif you thought that was great, wait and see what I‚Äôm bringing you next.‚Äù It never failed either‚Äîeach new course was even better than the previous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Making This Work in Any Business&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post is a call to action for us to think before we interact with our customers. How can we convey our confidence and pride in our product and how can we better time our questions to the customer so that they can give us valuable feedback and we can bring them the ‚Äúnext course‚Äù with the maximum effect.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Speaker Deck&#39;s Technology Stack</title>
    <link href="https://jonmagic.com/posts/speaker-decks-technology-stack/"/>
    <updated>2011-07-29T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://jonmagic.com/posts/speaker-decks-technology-stack/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Ever curious about what the software stack for programs you use looks like? I am, so I thought I‚Äôd share what Speaker Deck‚Äôs technology stack looks like right now, and then I can look back a year from now and see how much it has changed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://speakerdeck.com/&quot;&gt;Speaker Deck&lt;/a&gt; is a simple application. You upload a PDF of a presentation that has been exported from Keynote, PowerPoint, or something similar, and it turns it into a deck of images that are easily viewed through an HTML5 slide browser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;High-Level&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what makes it tick? Here‚Äôs the rundown from a high level:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;html/css/javascript: currently we don‚Äôt use Flash anywhere&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rubyonrails.org/&quot;&gt;Ruby on Rails&lt;/a&gt; web framework&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A bunch of ruby gems which I‚Äôll list below&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://mongodb.org/&quot;&gt;MongoDB&lt;/a&gt;, a high-performance document-oriented database&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://redis.io/&quot;&gt;Redis&lt;/a&gt;, an advanced key-value store&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://fog.io/&quot;&gt;FOG&lt;/a&gt;, technically a ruby gem, which gets its own section below, but had to mention it here as it makes storing files in the cloud super easy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Service Providers&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Platform as a service and software as a service providers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://heroku.com/&quot;&gt;Heroku&lt;/a&gt; is a platform for easily and quickly deploying, hosting, and scaling applications built on Ruby, Node.js, and now Clojure. A simple ‚Äúgit push heroku‚Äù lets us deploy to the cloud.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://mongohq.com/&quot;&gt;MongoHQ&lt;/a&gt; is where we host our MongoDB database. They manage the servers so we don‚Äôt have to.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://redistogo.com/&quot;&gt;Redis To Go&lt;/a&gt; is a hosted Redis database solution. We use Redis for job queues and Redis To Go lets us quickly scale our database to meet our needs at the time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://aws.amazon.com/s3/&quot;&gt;Amazon Simple Storage Service&lt;/a&gt;, otherwise known as Amazon S3, is a quick and easy way for us to host thousands of slides and PDFs without going broke. They charge by the gigabyte for bandwidth and storage and it‚Äôs darn cheap.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Ruby Gems&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a few more pieces of software we use for testing but this post is already getting kind of long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what are you using in your software stack?&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Compiling Executables on Heroku</title>
    <link href="https://jonmagic.com/posts/compiling-executables-on-heroku/"/>
    <updated>2011-07-28T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://jonmagic.com/posts/compiling-executables-on-heroku/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Are you using Heroku and want to run a program not included in the Heroku environment? I‚Äôm going to show you how.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For &lt;a href=&quot;http://speakerdeck.com/&quot;&gt;Speaker Deck&lt;/a&gt; we wanted to be able to extract the text from uploaded pdf‚Äôs so that we can index them and make them searchable, but the program we‚Äôd been using to do this on our dev machines, pdftotext (part of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://foolabs.com/xpdf/&quot;&gt;XPDF&lt;/a&gt; library), wasn‚Äôt available on our &lt;a href=&quot;http://heroku.com/&quot;&gt;Heroku&lt;/a&gt; instances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a whim I typed ‚Äúheroku run bash‚Äù and sure enough I was dropped into a bash shell with our Heroku Cedar Stack instance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;heroku run &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;bash&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I went into our app‚Äôs tmp directory and tried a wget with the xpdf url, but it failed so I tried curl with the -o option to output to file and it worked. Then I unzipped the file and started building it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;curl&lt;/span&gt; ftp://ftp.foolabs.com/pub/xpdf/xpdf-3.02.tar.gz &lt;span class=&quot;token parameter variable&quot;&gt;-o&lt;/span&gt; xpdf.tar.gz
&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;tar&lt;/span&gt; zxvf xpdf.tar.gz
&lt;span class=&quot;token builtin class-name&quot;&gt;cd&lt;/span&gt; xpdf-3.02
./configure
&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;make&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it was done building I found the executable we needed, pdftotext, sitting in the xpdf build directory. I scp‚Äôd it to my machine, created a bin directory in our app‚Äôs folder, and stuck the executable there. Then with a quick git commit and git push to Heroku we were in business!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I had an environment locally that was identical to the Heroku instance I could have built it locally, but to ensure it was built to run on the Heroku instance it just made sense to build it there in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bin directory was added to the app‚Äôs path automatically so I was able to execute the pdftotext program from inside our Rails app without a hitch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt; Josh Peek commented on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2816783&quot;&gt;Hacker News post&lt;/a&gt; that he bundled the xpdf source in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/josh/ruby-xpdf&quot;&gt;gem which compiles itself at runtime&lt;/a&gt;‚Ä¶ Probably a better longterm solution as it works if the underlying environment changes enough to break a prebuilt binary.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Moving Speaker Deck to Heroku</title>
    <link href="https://jonmagic.com/posts/moving-speaker-deck-to-heroku/"/>
    <updated>2011-07-27T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://jonmagic.com/posts/moving-speaker-deck-to-heroku/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;While at RailsConf earlier this year we decided that it would be wise to move Speaker Deck to Heroku and S3, and we finally made it happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;History&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://speakerdeck.com/&quot;&gt;Speaker Deck&lt;/a&gt; has been my labor of love since June 1st of last year. &lt;a href=&quot;http://orderedlist.com/the-team/#steve-smith&quot;&gt;Steve&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://orderedlist.com/the-team/#john-nunemaker&quot;&gt;John&lt;/a&gt; had the idea and I set about making it happen in my spare time. It launched October 20th 2010 (with a lot of help from Steve and John) and has been purring along quietly since then. We‚Äôve had 38 people request beta signups and as of today 85 presentations have been uploaded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Getting Started&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So back to point of this post, we decided that this app, with its hunger for lots of background workers (to process slides) and its desire to scale as adoption grows, mandated that we figure out a scaling strategy that worked for the app, and worked for us and our resources at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had been tossing &lt;a href=&quot;http://heroku.com/&quot;&gt;Heroku&lt;/a&gt; around in the back of our minds for awhile and after talking to a couple of the Heroku guys at &lt;a href=&quot;http://railsconf.com/&quot;&gt;RailsConf&lt;/a&gt; and having them check if their system had some software we needed (imagemagick/ghostscript), we decided to give it a go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just a few days ago I decided to get to work on it after talking to my coworkers about how to make it happen. &lt;a href=&quot;http://orderedlist.com/the-team/#brandon-keepers&quot;&gt;Brandon&lt;/a&gt; and I dug in and implemented storing slides on S3 (instead of MongoDB‚Äôs gridfs) in just a few short hours thanks to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jnicklas/carrierwave&quot;&gt;Carrierwave&lt;/a&gt; gem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It just so happened that this weekend was the &lt;a href=&quot;http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2011/7/14/rails-3-1-hackfest&quot;&gt;Rails 3.1 hackfest&lt;/a&gt;, so Saturday we upgraded the app to Rails 3.1 and then to use Ruby 1.9.2 so it could run on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/cedar&quot;&gt;Heroku Cedar Stack&lt;/a&gt;. Next we started working on deploying to Heroku.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Deploying&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deploying ended up being a lot of trial and error. First I ran into an issue with Heroku‚Äôs bundler version (a release candidate) not being able to find one of my dependencies, but that was solved with the handy ‚Äúbundle cache‚Äù command. You just do &lt;code&gt;bundle cache&lt;/code&gt; and then check &lt;code&gt;vendor/cache&lt;/code&gt; into your repo and it sends all the gems up (still in the compressed gem form) so bundler can install them from the &lt;code&gt;vendor/cache&lt;/code&gt; dir.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally I couldn‚Äôt get my resque workers to run in the right environment, turns out I was missing &lt;code&gt;task &#39;resque:setup&#39; =&amp;gt; :environment&lt;/code&gt; in my Rakefile. Hadn‚Äôt needed that on our previous deploy to &lt;a href=&quot;http://linode.com/&quot;&gt;Linode&lt;/a&gt;, so it took awhile for me figure that one out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Migrating&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brandon and I wrote a script to migrate the data on the old Linode server to our local database and at the same time suck the pdf‚Äôs out of Mongo on the old server and then put them on S3 rather than keeping them in gridfs. Then a quick mongodump and mongorestore later our production data was synced from my local machine to our new MongoHQ database.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that the pdf‚Äôs were on S3 and the mongo database was populated we just had to reprocess the pdf‚Äôs into slides. Technically we could have grabbed the already generated slides from the old server, but we really wanted to see how much we could scale our worker processes on Heroku.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here‚Äôs the fun part! After a few failed starts (I‚Äôll talk about those in a minute) we had 100 heroku workers processing 5000 slides (an intensive imagemagick/ghostscript task) and it ripped thru them all in just a few minutes. It was awesome to watch the resque web console and typing &lt;code&gt;heroku ps:scale worker=100&lt;/code&gt; was a lot of fun!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Heroku Scaling Gotchya‚Äôs&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DO NOT&lt;/strong&gt; remove workers while you are processing a bunch of stuff unless your jobs are easy to restart. Heroku kills the processes not caring if they were already working on something, leaving jobs in limbo üòï&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DO NOT&lt;/strong&gt; change (upgrade/downgrade) your RedisToGo plan while workers are running, your redis db gets replaced instantly, losing any currently processing jobs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Wrap Up&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall this was a fairly painless move and it was so exciting to scale up our background workers and watch 20 slides a second get processed. Now that Speaker Deck is on Heroku and S3 we have one less constraint holding us back from releasing new features and hopefully leaving beta soon.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Best Work Days</title>
    <link href="https://jonmagic.com/posts/the-best-work-days/"/>

    <id>https://jonmagic.com/posts/the-best-work-days/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Today was an awesome day at work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of my favorite kind of work days is when we‚Äôre all working on different things, we‚Äôre all in the zone, and we‚Äôre all in the same room. Today was one of those days with Steve, John, and I all hacking on new features for &lt;a href=&quot;http://orderedlist.com/products/&quot;&gt;our products&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every hour or two one of us would leave our keyboard and gather the others to show what we‚Äôd got done and take input from the other two. Then the others would take their turns in the spotlight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me at least this routine throughout the day kept me pumped up and excited about my progress and pushed me to make even more headway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm pretty psyched about what each of us are working on and I‚Äôm really excited to show you soon!&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Changing the way you live your life sounds weird, and drastic, but I have to admit that I‚Äôm really starting to enjoy it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been constantly connected to everyone I know, via my cell phone and the internet, for over a decade and a half now, except for a few rare occasions (like my wedding) where I left the cell phone behind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has always frustrated me that my wife often won‚Äôt reply to emails for weeks, never cared to hang out on twitter, was never interested in reading my blog, and basically has never made modern communication (even her cell phone, she rarely answers it) an important part of her daily routine. But she seems perfectly happy and a lot of the time less stressed than myself, so I decided to re-evaluate how I use these tools to see if I‚Äôm doing it wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I left my job at &lt;a href=&quot;http://sabretechllc.com/&quot;&gt;SabreTech&lt;/a&gt; the first big change I made was leaving my phone on silent all day, everyday, unless I‚Äôm expecting a call that I really want to get. The iPhone still vibrates, so if it‚Äôs in my pocket or next to my hands on my desk I‚Äôll notice it ringing, and most of the time I‚Äôll pick it up. But not worrying about getting every call is a better way to live, trust me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next up was not hovering over &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/jonmagic&quot;&gt;twitter&lt;/a&gt; every second of the day. I still open it three or four times at work and a half a dozen times in the evening, but it‚Äôs not open all the time anymore, with its little icon constantly distracting me that there are new tweets waiting to be read. Another source of anxiety lifted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new source of anxiety introduced itself last year when I started playing Words with Friends. I quickly learned that I would go insane if I didn‚Äôt turn off the notifications it sends you every time someone you‚Äôre playing against takes their turn. Later I learned how to turn off the badge notification telling me how many games were waiting on me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the biggest change I‚Äôve made to date was two weeks ago when I turned off push email on my iPhone. In fact, unless I open my mail app it &lt;strong&gt;NEVER&lt;/strong&gt; goes out and checks for new mail. Now I check my mail in the morning when I get up, keep my mail client open during the day for work, and then don‚Äôt look at it again until the next morning. This has been a huge change, for two reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, I‚Äôm not constantly distracted while spending time with my friends and family. They get more of my attention, which makes them happier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, I‚Äôm not constantly being reminded of work and what I have to do the next day. I can actually spend time enjoying life outside of work, I can stop obsessing on silly things, and I can just enjoy all of God‚Äôs blessings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Try it, but let me warn you, you‚Äôll probably like it üòÉ&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Obsession and Understanding</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve been emotionally up and down a lot the past few months and a lot of it has had to do with work. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I love my job, and therein lies the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve always been very passionate about my work, but as I get older and learn more about life, I‚Äôm realizing I need to put things into better perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obsessing about one area of your life is unhealthy. Religion, politics, work, hobbies, or family; obsessing over any of these can lead to anxiety, stress, and dissatisfaction with life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God has been teaching me lately that I need to put my hope in Him, that I need to understand my joy will never come directly from any of those areas of life I mentioned above, but that it can come from recognizing His work in my life in all of those arenas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right now I need to stop obsessing on what I want out of my job, and start understanding how I‚Äôm learning and growing in my job.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Thank you</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Recognizing someone‚Äôs hard work and thanking them for it is always worth it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm in Dallas right now on business and one of the nice things about the place I‚Äôm staying at is they always give you a tray of three chocolates on your bed when you first arrive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, I ate my three chocolates within 48 hours of arriving and this morning all I could think about was having another one. So selfishly I began to compose a message on the notepad next to my bed asking for more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While writing the little note to the person who cleans the room I began to think how awesome it was that they actually took the time to do it, making my bed, replacing the towels, emptying the trash, and who knows what else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I ended up writing a note to them thanking them for their hard work and politely asking if it was possible for me to get another chocolate. I even made a little papier-mache flower out of one of the used chocolate wrappers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I got back to my room later in the day the tray was on the bed with five, YES, FIVE, chocolates!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moral of the story? Think about what others do for you, even if it is their job, and thank them for it. They will appreciate it and you‚Äôll get chocolate (ok, so maybe not all the time).&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Smoker - Back Story and First Day</title>
    <link href="https://jonmagic.com/posts/the-smoker---back-story-and-first-day/"/>
    <updated>2011-05-12T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://jonmagic.com/posts/the-smoker---back-story-and-first-day/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve been planning on building a 55 gallon smoker for almost a year and a half now, but the time and resources just haven‚Äôt been there. Today marked the first day of real progress!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It all started when this &lt;a href=&quot;http://jmillerid.com/wordpress/2009/12/55-gallon-drum-smoker/&quot;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; appeared a year and a half ago. I saw it and I immediately fell in love. I‚Äôd only been smoking for a few months at that point, with a $35 Brinkman, but I‚Äôd already developed a passion for good BBQ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the spring of 2010 I jumped on Craigslist and found a couple of barrels only 2 miles from my house, and immediately bought them. But then, as often happens to me, I set the dream of building it aside because of fear of starting and my many excuses like lack of tools, lack of time, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the dream persisted, and when I found out my parents would be returning from Argentina for a few months this summer I decided to enlist my dad‚Äôs help and get this thing rockin!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A week ago we set today as the day to begin, which left me just a few days to prepare. Preparation meant getting a jigsaw, a welder, and this &lt;a href=&quot;http://jmillerid.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/intersecting_curve2.jpg&quot;&gt;curve pattern&lt;/a&gt; printed to scale. I decided the building would need to be broken into phases, for financial and time reasons, so this first day I limited to just needing the jigsaw and curve pattern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buying a jigsaw, easy. Printing a 70‚Äù curve, not as easy üòï&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story of acquiring the curve requires some back story. Again, I‚Äôve been planning on building this thing for over a year, so I actually started searching out a plotter to print it a year ago. At the time I worked at &lt;a href=&quot;http://sabretechllc.com/&quot;&gt;SabreTech&lt;/a&gt; and we had quite a few industrial clients with printers, but I never managed to find the right place to get it done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One day seven or eight months ago while visiting my college friend Bob at his workplace &lt;a href=&quot;http://daavlin.com/&quot;&gt;Daavlin&lt;/a&gt; (also one of our best clients) I noticed they had a plotter. Bob proceeded to explain that they‚Äôd just acquired it, but hadn‚Äôt figured out way to hook it up yet (older interface that none of their computers had). I offered to help (I think) in exchange for printing the curve, but he said he‚Äôd get it running and told me he‚Äôd print the curve anyways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fast forward to yesterday morning (seven+ months later). I left for work thinking that I‚Äôd need to find a way to print that curve. I got halfway to work and realized I‚Äôd forgotten my lunch, so I turned around and went back home. As I pulled in the driveway I noticed a package on the front step. I grabbed it, ran inside, cut open the package, and lo and behold there was my curve printed to scale! Somehow Bob managed to time printing and sending it to me so perfectly that it arrived the day I was going to print it myself. Awesome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So today I went and grabbed a jigsaw, some blades for cutting metal, and dad and I got to work this evening. We focused just on the cutting phase, and knocked it out in short order! &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/jonmagic/sets/72157626583429183/show/&quot;&gt;Here are some pics&lt;/a&gt; for your enjoyment üòÉ Sorry, forgot to wear a shirt in a few üòï&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Priorities</title>
    <link href="https://jonmagic.com/posts/priorities/"/>
    <updated>2011-03-05T00:00:00Z</updated>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Balancing your home and work life can be terribly difficult, especially when you love your job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Shut It Off&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last night my wife and I went on a date, first out to dinner and then to grab a movie to watch at home. Once back home she was getting ready to watch the movie while I popped the DVD in and queued it up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I popped open my laptop and noticed our work chat had been blowing up and instantly got sucked in. My coworkers were hacking on &lt;a href=&quot;http://gaug.es/&quot;&gt;Gaug.es&lt;/a&gt; and doing some awesome stuff with async and EventMachine and I immediately wanted to be a part of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead I closed my laptop just in time to see my wife coming into the living room ready to watch the movie. This wasn‚Äôt an easy decision, but it was the right decision, one I haven‚Äôt made hundreds of times in the past, to the detriment of our relationship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spending time with your loved ones (in my case my wife and dogs) must take priority over your work life. What kind of message do you send to them if you always leave that laptop open? Not that you are dedicated, or that you are providing for them, you are sending the message that you care more about work than you care about them. They don‚Äôt get over this easily, trust me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm not saying you can‚Äôt work at home or in the evenings, I‚Äôm saying that it‚Äôs important to set aside and dedicate &lt;strong&gt;the majority&lt;/strong&gt; of your home life to spending time with and sharing your life with those you love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Dream At Home&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the reasons it has been so easy for me to make the wrong decision in the past, to work late every night, is that I love my work, I‚Äôm excited about it, and often that excitement feels greater than anything I‚Äôm excited about at home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has been important for my wife and I to find things that we‚Äôre both excited about, which in our case is food and travel, and spend time talking about or doing those things every day. We spend anywhere from one to three hours in the kitchen every night, cooking, sharing stories from our day, &lt;a href=&quot;http://orderedlist.com/blog/articles/share-the-dream/&quot;&gt;sharing our dreams&lt;/a&gt; and just being best friends. No computers (except to play some music), no hacking, just spending quality time together enjoying each other‚Äôs company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Exceptions to the Rule&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having said all that, I still choose to work late two or three evenings every week. I feel like (and my wife agrees) that it is hard to get ahead in life, hard to take things to the next level, if you don‚Äôt kick it up a notch every once in awhile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My wife and I don‚Äôt plan on living in Elkhart, Indiana the rest of our lives, we dream of moving to Italy, so we feel like burning the midnight oil a couple nights a week to make that dream happen sooner is totally worth it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last thing I would caution on working at home is that you prepare for it, warn those who may depend on you so they can plan accordingly. I also try and pitch in a little extra effort that day, making sure chores are done, whatever I can do so she doesn‚Äôt feel like she‚Äôs on her own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P.S. I had no idea it was the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/03/04/national-day-of-unplugging_n_831176.html&quot;&gt;National Day of Unplugging&lt;/a&gt; when I wrote this.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Share the Dream</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Sharing in the vision and energy of your team is a key factor to success and happiness at work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Putting Your Dreams On Hold&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I started at OrderedList there was &lt;a href=&quot;http://speakerdeck.com/&quot;&gt;one product&lt;/a&gt; I was really passionate about because I had done most of the work on it. I quickly realized though that I needed to put that passion on hold, or better said, redirect it towards &lt;a href=&quot;http://harmonyapp.com/&quot;&gt;Harmony&lt;/a&gt;, so that I could help push the vision of my team forward. I needed to share their dreams and hopefully incorporate mine at some point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As soon as I dug into &lt;a href=&quot;http://harmonyapp.com/&quot;&gt;Harmony&lt;/a&gt;, fixing weak spots in the test suite, spearheading the move to Rails 3, working on a new feature (&lt;strong&gt;that I‚Äôm dying to tell you about&lt;/strong&gt;), my heart began to change, my passion became their passion, and I was happy again and part of the team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Sharing The Energy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almost as soon as I really started getting passionate about &lt;a href=&quot;http://harmonyapp.com/&quot;&gt;Harmony&lt;/a&gt; John came home from sick leave and had this crazy idea to build a &lt;a href=&quot;http://gaug.es/&quot;&gt;web analytics service&lt;/a&gt;, which we now call &lt;a href=&quot;http://gaug.es/&quot;&gt;Gauges&lt;/a&gt;. At first all I could think was, &lt;strong&gt;boring&lt;/strong&gt;, but hanging around Steve, John, and Brandon I started to catch the buzz, the energy, and the excitement!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is when I began to realize that I didn‚Äôt necessarily have to put my dreams on hold, I just needed to share in my team‚Äôs excitement and get them excited about what I‚Äôm excited about by letting them see my own energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every team is different, but letting your coworkers see your excitement and passion about a product/project and sharing in their dreams at the same time is one easy way to stay happy at work and be excited to go to the office every day.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New Guy Blues</title>
    <link href="https://jonmagic.com/posts/new-guy-blues/"/>
    <updated>2011-03-02T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://jonmagic.com/posts/new-guy-blues/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Being the new guy in your workplace can be intimidating. It can cause anxiety, frustration, and hamper your productivity. Sometimes it‚Äôs your coworkers not making it easy for you, sometimes it‚Äôs just you, your mindset, willingness to stretch your limits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm one of the new guys at OrderedList and I‚Äôd like to share three things that helped me jumpstart my productivity at OrderedList and catapult me to being a key part of the team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Servants Heart&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is something we should all apply, regardless of whether we‚Äôre the new guy, but it‚Äôs especially helpful when trying to fit into a new environment. Having a servant‚Äôs heart means you are constantly looking for the best way to serve those around you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You notice someone has a stuffy nose, grab them some kleenex. A coworker is frustrated with what he‚Äôs working on, ask him if he‚Äôd like to use you as a sounding board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being aware of others‚Äô needs and acting on it makes you instantly useful to the team and endears you to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Find A Mentor&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting a new job means learning how to do new things. Some people can just jump in without help and do an amazing job; I‚Äôm not one of those people. I found at this job that watching, recognizing, and imitating patterns of work was the quickest way for me to get directly involved in what we do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thankfully I have the opportunity almost every day to pair program with our other new guy, &lt;a href=&quot;http://orderedlist.com/the-team/#brandon-keepers&quot;&gt;Brandon&lt;/a&gt;, who has years more experience than I do. I do the best I can as a pair partner, catching typos, helping with decisions, and more, but most importantly I‚Äôm watching every line of code he writes, understanding it, and asking questions when I don‚Äôt, so that later I can imitate and create beautiful code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could just dive in on projects and do things the way I know how to do them, but finding someone smarter than you to imitate pushes you to continue expanding what you know how to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Do What You Know&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The past month and a few days we‚Äôve been working on a new product, &lt;a href=&quot;http://gaug.es/&quot;&gt;Gauges&lt;/a&gt;, in our spare time. A lot of the tech on this project I had never used before, so initially I found it hard to jump in and help. I paired and helped when I could, but I really wanted to contribute on my own. Then the opportunity arose to work on the admin section, something I knew how to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I dove right in, here was something I could contribute with little to no help from my team, and it was something that they could appreciate day to day. Sometimes you need to step back, do what you know, and get that instant rush of being a valuable member on the team, a contributor, and not so much the new guy anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A WebDev&#39;s notes on native Android/iPhone app development</title>
    <link href="https://jonmagic.com/posts/a-webdevs-notes-on-native-androidiphone-app-development/"/>
    <updated>2010-11-26T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://jonmagic.com/posts/a-webdevs-notes-on-native-androidiphone-app-development/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I was contracted to build a fairly simple phototherapy treatment time calculator app for one of our clients recently, and in the process learned A LOT about developing for the iPhone and Android using html/css/javascript.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The requirements for the job were that the final app feel native and that it be able to be purchased on the respective market place (Appstore or Android Market).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôd already written the &lt;a href=&quot;http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/daavlin-phototherapy-dose/id386168638?mt=8&quot;&gt;app once for the iPhone&lt;/a&gt;, using the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jqtouch.com/&quot;&gt;jqTouch&lt;/a&gt; library and then wrapping the whole thing with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.phonegap.com/&quot;&gt;PhoneGap&lt;/a&gt;, but this time around the client wanted to add some features that made me look further than jqTouch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initially I fantasized about a write once deploy twice approach using something like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.appcelerator.com/products/titanium-mobile-application-development/&quot;&gt;Appcelerator Titanium&lt;/a&gt;. The more I read however the more I realized no matter how I went about this project I was going to end up with more than one codebase, one for the iPhone and at least one for the Android. I decided to go ahead with Appcelerator however and developed for the iPhone first. One of the biggest things I was looking for was a native bottom tab bar for navigating between the different phototherapy calculators (UVB, UVA, UVA1, and Blue), and Appcelerator let me quickly build a native, beautiful, functional app that exactly fit the clients needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a bit of troubleshooting I had it deploying to my actual iPhone, but no matter how hard I tried I could never manage to get it to deploy to the Android emulator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next I started working on a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sencha.com/products/touch/&quot;&gt;Sencha Touch&lt;/a&gt; version of the app, which I planned to wrap with PhoneGap, but after about an hour of digging around in Sencha I decided it didn‚Äôt fit my programming aesthetic. I also talked to someone who wrote an app in Sencha and they said it had a ways to go with speed, animations were still jerky on older hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally I decided to give &lt;a href=&quot;http://jquerymobile.com/&quot;&gt;JqueryMobile&lt;/a&gt; a try (thanx Xian!) and it was a great fit for a webdev like me. Using the latest PhoneGap and JqueryMobile I had the app rewritten and running on the Android Emulator in just under 2 hours, and then another 2 hours tweaking the interface and interactions. If you know html/css/javascript, you can write a fairly native feeling app in no time with JqueryMobile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having used jqTouch, Appcelerator, JqueryMobile, PhoneGap, and having looked at Sencha, I have to say Appcelerator was by far the best experience. I enjoyed programming the interface rather than laying out the html and then styling it with CSS. I enjoyed how quickly and easy it was to deploy to the iPhone (I wish it could do the same for Android!). Most of all I loved how it built a native interface, which beats an html5 interface almost every time in my opinion.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>What laptop to get?</title>
    <link href="https://jonmagic.com/posts/what-laptop-to-get/"/>
    <updated>2010-11-20T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://jonmagic.com/posts/what-laptop-to-get/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://jonmagic.com/post/1611565836/hey-mom-i-got-a-job&quot;&gt;As you know&lt;/a&gt;
I‚Äôm taking a new job. New job means new laptop, and I‚Äôm having a terrible time deciding what Mac to get. Just browsing Apple‚Äôs website I fell in love with the new &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.apple.com/macbookair/&quot;&gt;13‚Äù Macbook Air&lt;/a&gt;, but the feedback on Twitter has been 50/50 for/against. Some think it works just fine as a development machine, especially with the rockin‚Äô SSD and 4GB of RAM, but others worry that going from MBP to the Air will leave you wanting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve been using a 15‚Äù 2.53 GHz Core 2 Duo Macbook Pro with 4GB of RAM for a few months now, and even it is not fast enough for me (looks like it‚Äôs the HDD that‚Äôs the bottleneck most of the time though).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I figured I needed some hands on, so I stopped by our &lt;a href=&quot;http://gowalla.com/spots/6424797&quot;&gt;new Apple store in Mishawaka&lt;/a&gt; today and played with several different models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;11‚Äù Macbook Air:&lt;/strong&gt; this thing is tiny. I liked it except for the giant surround around the screen, it makes the screen look way too small. Give me a 1/2 to 3/4 bezel, not an inch and a quarter!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;13‚Äù Macbook Air:&lt;/strong&gt; wow is she pretty, but it would definitely take some getting used to. It has the same number of pixels as my 15‚Äù but crammed into a 13‚Äù screen. I do love the weight to size ratio though. I couldn‚Äôt really run any speed tests, but the thing was dang fast from what I could tell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;15‚Äù Macbook Pro:&lt;/strong&gt; I tried out one of the i5‚Äôs with 8GB of RAM and an SSD and it was screaming. The only downside is the thickness/weight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My conclusion at this moment in time is that Apple needs to make me a 15‚Äù Macbook Air! I don‚Äôt need an optical drive, I want tons of pixels, but I also want that bigger 15‚Äù screen. Imagine a 15‚Äù with an i5 processor, still super thin, and a 10 hour battery, all weighing under 4 pounds. I say hot hot hot‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know it‚Äôs a pipe dream, but hey, boys gotta dream sometimes right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôd love to hear from anyone using the new Macbook Air, what has your experience been?&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;How a butler was born.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well folks, 2010 has been quite a year. Three of my close friends got married, my lil‚Äôsis is getting married next month, my best friend is having a baby, and I have decided to leave &lt;a href=&quot;http://sabretechllc.com/&quot;&gt;SabreTech&lt;/a&gt; and take a job at &lt;a href=&quot;http://orderedlist.com/&quot;&gt;OrderedList&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Woh! Wait a second Jon, aren‚Äôt you part owner in &lt;a href=&quot;http://sabretechllc.com/&quot;&gt;SabreTech&lt;/a&gt;? Indeed I am, but with the news of my departure my business partners have decided to buy me out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how did I get to where I‚Äôm at now?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First I‚Äôd like to take a quick look back.¬†I bought &lt;a href=&quot;http://sabretechllc.com/&quot;&gt;SabreTech&lt;/a&gt; in 2005 with Brad Cochran and together we turned it into a profitable and growing business. In 2007 Sam Sallows joined the team and we made him a partner in a little over a year. SabreTech has been growing since we bought it, but the addition of Sam really made things go crazy. SabreTech has grown 400% in 5 years and the rate of growth is increasing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After my wife and I moved to Indiana in 2007 with the hopes of expanding SabreTech, it quickly became apparent that the economy in Elkhart couldn‚Äôt support a second store. To make up for my down time in Indiana I started to really apply myself at software development, learning everything I could. That love of programming took me to a &lt;a href=&quot;http://groups.google.com/group/southbendrb?pli=1&quot;&gt;little group&lt;/a&gt; that met monthly at Notre Dame to talk about programming (specifically about using Ruby and Rails). At that meeting I met &lt;a href=&quot;http://orderedlist.com/who-we-are/#steve&quot;&gt;Steve Smith&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://orderedlist.com/who-we-are/#john&quot;&gt;John Nunemaker&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steve had left Notre Dame to start &lt;a href=&quot;http://orderedlist.com/&quot;&gt;OrderedList&lt;/a&gt; and shortly after I met them John left Notre Dame to join Steve. Over the past couple of years we started to hang out more during work hours (meeting in coffee shops and eventually at their office) and after hours (Notre Dame tailgates, the Super Bowl).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apparently John and Steve saw something in me that they liked, because they offered me a job, and yesterday my wife and I decided to take it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That brings us to today, two weeks and one day before my last day of work at SabreTech. I start at &lt;a href=&quot;http://orderedlist.com/&quot;&gt;OrderedList&lt;/a&gt;¬†on December 6th! I‚Äôll be handling customer support for their product &lt;a href=&quot;http://harmonyapp.com/&quot;&gt;Harmony&lt;/a&gt;, as well as programming on various projects from &lt;a href=&quot;http://speakerdeck.com/&quot;&gt;SpeakerDeck&lt;/a&gt; to client work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will be the first time in 10 years that I haven‚Äôt been a business owner and have an actual boss (already practicing my ‚Äúyes boss‚Äù). I‚Äôm sure it will be an adjustment, but I honestly look forward to having less stress, better hours, and a 20 minute commute (as opposed to 90).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm crazy excited to be working with Steve and John, they are two of the smartest people I know, and both love to teach and push their peers to the limit. I‚Äôm going to be in an environment where constantly learning new things is a necessity, not just an aspiration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So yeah, mom, I went and got a job üòâ&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UPDATE:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://orderedlist.com/our-writing/blog/articles/welcome-jon-hoyt/&quot;&gt;Read the announcement over on the OrderedList blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <id>https://jonmagic.com/posts/46-monument-avenue/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This summer my wife and I planned a trip to Boston for our best friend‚Äôs wedding. While getting ready to book a room I came across &lt;a href=&quot;http://techcrunch.com/2010/07/25/fawlty-logic/&quot;&gt;an article&lt;/a&gt; about &lt;a href=&quot;http://airbnb.com/&quot;&gt;airbnb.com&lt;/a&gt;, so I decided to give it a try. The first 3 attempts to get a room failed, but each time Airbnb sent me a better coupon so I kept trying. The fourth attempt got me &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.airbnb.com/rooms/45987&quot;&gt;46 Monument Avenue&lt;/a&gt;, and it was the best purchase I‚Äôve made in a year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a very reasonable price ($100 per night) we got a cute studio apartment with a private patio, in Charlestown, just a short distance from the North Side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The host, Atef Aziz, emailed us before arrival to find out more about us. He was helpful enough to get us into the room at 10am on our check-in day, rather than having to wait until 3 or 4pm (like most hotels). He was eager to help in any way, from walking or driving directions, to restaurant recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The apartment is adorable, a studio apartment with a nice large bathroom and stand-up shower. It had a functional kitchen (larger than our kitchen at home), washer/dryer, TV with basic channels, Wi-Fi internet, and an amazing little patio. The patio has a fountain with goldfish, a table with umbrella and chairs, a charcoal grill (the only way to grill), and lots of flowers and fauna. The apartment was only a 10-minute walk to the North Side of Boston and an 8-minute walk to the T (orange line).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shower was initially not as hot as I like my showers, but a quick email to Atef got that fixed. The apartment was small, but open, and the kitchen entirely usable. The first night it was a bit warm, so I mentioned it to Atef and he got us a fan, which fixed the problem. The patio was perfect for relaxing in the morning, hanging out during the day, and winding down at night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can‚Äôt recommend &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.airbnb.com/rooms/45987&quot;&gt;46 Monument Avenue&lt;/a&gt; and Atef Aziz enough. From his hospitality to the beautifully furnished accommodations, this stay in Boston was a delight.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Death of Free</title>
    <link href="https://jonmagic.com/posts/the-death-of-free/"/>
    <updated>2010-09-09T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://jonmagic.com/posts/the-death-of-free/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm predicting the death of free in the next one or two years. You heard it here first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What the heck am I talking about? It used to be in our house that we only used services on the internet that were free, flickr, delicious, youtube, clearcheckbook, etc. In the past two years we have shifted to using Flickr Pro, Pinboard, Vimeo Pro, ClearCheckBook Pro, Rdio, and Netflix streaming, just to name a few.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only have we upgraded to the pro version of almost every internet service we use, but we also usually don‚Äôt start using a new service unless it has a paid version. Why? There are two primary reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Companies charging money for their service are more likely to be around in 5 years.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I‚Äôm more likely to use a service if I‚Äôm paying for it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second reason is more interesting. It helps me weed out things in my life that are wasting my time. If I‚Äôm not willing to pay for something to use it, it most likely isn‚Äôt worthy of me spending any time to use it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think my generation (and my gen‚Äôs kids) are finally starting to take to heart the old saying ‚Äúyou get what you pay for‚Äù. Free stuff is for the most part crap, has strings attached, and ends up being a time sink.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Freemium model still works, but I think its on the way out. The model that makes more sense to me is either just a great demo &amp;amp; paid service, or a free trial that pushes to paid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course the irony of this post is I‚Äôm not paying for &lt;a href=&quot;http://tumblr.com/&quot;&gt;Tumblr&lt;/a&gt;, and I can‚Äôt seem to find anywhere where I can give them money. However, I am choosing &lt;a href=&quot;http://tumblr.com/&quot;&gt;Tumblr&lt;/a&gt; as my micro-blogging platform over &lt;a href=&quot;http://posterous.com/&quot;&gt;Posterous&lt;/a&gt; because I think they are more likely to have a paid version in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Make Asterisk use Gmail for emailing faxes</title>
    <link href="https://jonmagic.com/posts/make-asterisk-use-gmail-for-emailing-faxes/"/>
    <updated>2009-09-10T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://jonmagic.com/posts/make-asterisk-use-gmail-for-emailing-faxes/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;While &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.asterisk.org/&quot;&gt;Asterisk&lt;/a&gt; provides a simple way to replace sendmail when sending voicemails, the incoming fax portion of Asterisk is not so easily reconfigured. By studying how it handled an incoming fax from the Asterisk CLI I was able to find this perl script: &lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/184641/ddea153508f3373cf2f99ac8ba79fe99ce6fc2fd&quot;&gt; /var/lib/asterisk/bin/fax-process.pl&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This script uses Net::SMTP to send its faxes as attachments via email. We (and by we I mean &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.behindlogic.com/&quot;&gt;Daniel&lt;/a&gt;) rewired the perl script to use Net::SMTP::SSL instead and made it work with gmail!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were a few libraries I had to install via cpan:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;force install F/FL/FLORA/Net_SSLeay.pm-1.30.tar.gz&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;install S/SU/SULLR/IO-Socket-SSL-1.30.tar.gz&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;install GBARR/Authen-SASL-2.12.tar.gz&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;install C/CW/CWEST/Net-SMTP-SSL-1.01.tar.gz&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And finally here is the rewritten script!

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Just wanted to post a little something while I‚Äôm still here at &lt;a href=&quot;http://barcampgr.org/&quot;&gt;BarCampGR&lt;/a&gt;, an attendee driven conference. Its been great fun, as you can see from the many &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/#search?q=%23barcampgr&quot;&gt;posts to twitter&lt;/a&gt;‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Note to those who attended my talk on smoking meats, here are some great links:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://amazingribs.com/&quot;&gt;Amazing Ribs&lt;/a&gt; is the definitive place to learn about smoking ribs. Look at the page about Texas Crutch to find the perfect cooking method.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://getyourgrillon.net/2008/04/21/bite-through-smoked-chicken-skin/&quot;&gt;this chicken recipe&lt;/a&gt; is amazing, just make sure you cut down the salt they use in the brine, &lt;strong&gt;AND&lt;/strong&gt; the rub, by half, or it will be way too salty.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;kind of off topic, but &lt;a href=&quot;http://gist.github.com/129533&quot;&gt;this was a great recipe&lt;/a&gt;, even if it had nothing to do with smoking üòÉ&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;wanna see my original rig? &lt;a href=&quot;http://jonmagic.com/2008/11/1/temperature-time&quot;&gt;check it out&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>Best phone system for a small business, Part 1</title>
    <link href="https://jonmagic.com/posts/best-phone-system-for-a-small-business-part-1/"/>
    <updated>2009-08-16T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://jonmagic.com/posts/best-phone-system-for-a-small-business-part-1/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This article is for small business owners, and even better, for their IT guy/gal‚Ä¶ If you are looking at upgrading your phone system, and want to upgrade inexpensively but have a clear upgrade path for the future, I‚Äôm going to outline how to build what I believe to be the most cost effective, easy to maintain, pbx based phone system available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pbx itself is based on PC hardware, with a special card for interfacing with the telco (ATT, Verizon, etc), and a software stack called &lt;a href=&quot;http://pbxinaflash.net/&quot;&gt;PBX in a Flash&lt;/a&gt;. PBX in a Flash (PiaF) was put together &lt;a href=&quot;http://pbxinaflash.net/about/&quot;&gt;by a few gentlemen&lt;/a&gt; looking for a solid software stack for their telephony needs. Here is what is in the stack:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.centos.org/&quot;&gt;CentOS&lt;/a&gt; for the OS that everything lies on top of.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.asterisk.org/&quot;&gt;Asterisk&lt;/a&gt; for the PBX stack.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.freepbx.org/&quot;&gt;FreePBX&lt;/a&gt; helps in configuring and maintaining the Asterisk configuration.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prebuilt scripts, for configuring everything from dhcp to cisco phones&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For phone hardware I‚Äôve used Cisco, Linksys, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.aastra.com/&quot;&gt;Aastra&lt;/a&gt;. Aastra seems to be the recommended brand of late, for features, price, and ease of configuration. I‚Äôm not a huge fan of the Cisco phones (overpriced and they seem to cripple their SIP firmware), but Cisco‚Äôs economical product line, Linksys, makes some great phones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, there‚Äôs the intro for you, if you want to learn more, read on!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve done phone systems for businesses that only need 2 or 3 phones, and systems for companies with 20+ extensions. I‚Äôm comfortable recommending this system for a business with up to 100 extensions, more than that and you might want to look at having dual load balanced servers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this setup I‚Äôm going to describe below, we‚Äôve got a business with around 30 employees, 20 of which have their own extensions on the phone system. There is a sales group, support group, and various administrators, as well as production staff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any $400 to $600 PC will work for our base system. 2.0ghz+ Intel or AMD processor, at least 1gb of ram (I put in 2gb since its so cheap). Looking for hardware with a good warranty? Check out my company &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sabretechllc.com/&quot;&gt;SabreTech Consulting LLC&lt;/a&gt; for some great PC‚Äôs. We ship anywhere in the US (and actually, a lot of our PC‚Äôs are overseas as well, thru an associate of ours).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me back up for a second and explain the two ways we can get ‚Äúdial tone‚Äù to our phone system (i.e. be able to make calls to the outside world).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Way #1, use land lines thru your local telco, for example ATT or Verizon.
Way #2, use voip trunks thru any of hundreds of carriers, this method requires a NICE SOLID internet connection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Depending on your area and telco providers, it may or may not be more cost effective to use land lines thru the telco. These days I‚Äôve found that its usually cost effective to have enough land lines, with ‚Äúunlimited‚Äù long distance/local packages on them, for your average use (sum of the number of lines you use every minute of the day, divided by the number of minutes they are in use), and then voip trunks for ‚Äúpeak‚Äù times when you need Just A Little More, and for international calls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, we‚Äôve figured out that our average use is 4 to 6 lines in use at any given minute (this is just calls to the outside world, does not include internal calls, i.e. extension to extension). So we want to get 6 lines with unlimited local and long distance packages, which ends up costing about $456 a month. So how do we get these phone lines into our phone system?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok, time to step back again and explain the two ways the phone company can get us a line, digital or analog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Analog lines are the ones we had when we were growing up, you know, the phone on your wall in the kitchen üòÉ These analog lines are also called &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plain_old_telephone_service&quot;&gt;pots lines&lt;/a&gt;.
Digital lines, a.k.a. &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_rate_interface&quot;&gt;PRI‚Äôs&lt;/a&gt;, usually come in bundles of 23. In some areas you can get ‚Äúpartial‚Äù PRI‚Äôs, and if you can in your area, and the price is right, DO IT‚Ä¶  Digital lines will be better quality and give fewer headaches than analog lines. The nice thing about digital lines is they either WORK or they DON‚ÄôT WORK, there‚Äôs not much in-between. Analog lines on the other hand, can have a myriad of problems, including dropped calls, static, etc. Analog lines can work, even if the connection is crappy, and therefore its harder to convince the telco that there might be a problem with the line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I want some lines from my telco, but I need to get them INTO the phone system! My absolute favorite company for doing this is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rhinoequipment.com/&quot;&gt;Rhino Equipment&lt;/a&gt;. They make a series of analog and digital interface cards. These cards ARE NOT CHEAP, BUT they are worth every penny and more. In fact, I would pay twice the price they charge for them, and here is why: they have the best tech support I have ever used in my life. Let me repeat that. THEY HAVE THE BEST TECH SUPPORT ON THE PLANET. These guys have helped me time and time again, always courteous and patient. On one job they worked with me for 3 days trying to troubleshoot dropped calls, and said on day 2 that it wasn‚Äôt their equipment, but instead the phone company, but they stuck in there RIGHT TO THE END. They kept helping me, even after they knew it was the phone company and not their equipment causing problems, and if it weren‚Äôt for them, I never could have convinced the phone company to get their act together and fix the lines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For most small businesses, where I can‚Äôt get a PRI, only pots lines, I use the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rhinoequipment.com/R8FXXcard.html&quot;&gt;Rhino R8FXX-EC card&lt;/a&gt;. It can support up to 4 fxo (or fxs) modules on it. Each fxo module can handle 2 pots lines from the telco. This card has built in echo cancellation, just one more reason its worth every penny. For this example, since we‚Äôre going to have 6 lines, I need to get the Rhino card with 3 modules on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok, we‚Äôve got our PC, we‚Äôve got our interface card to interface with the telco, now we just need to pick a phone model to get everyone. I‚Äôm going to have to go with &lt;a href=&quot;http://nerdvittles.com/index.php?p=207&quot;&gt;this recommendation&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.aastra.com/cps/rde/xchg/SID-3D8CCB6A-BC5ACAC2/04/hs.xsl/19703.htm&quot;&gt;Aastra 57i&lt;/a&gt;. I have yet to get this particular model in to try myself, but I trust Ward Mundy with my life, so what he says, goes üòÉ&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, two pages in and I‚Äôve decided to split this into a multi part article. We‚Äôll call this Part I. Please keep checking back for Part II, where I‚Äôll cover installing and configuring the software stack and your Rhino card.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;My cousin and his wife Karen (i.e. Family) are visiting us this weekend.
My cuz is an artist, an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theicestudio.com/&quot;&gt;ice sculptor&lt;/a&gt; and he also &lt;a href=&quot;http://img30.yfrog.com/i/woz.jpg/&quot;&gt;works with sand&lt;/a&gt;! This is the second year he has visited us while doing work up in Niles MI, but the first time Karen has come to visit us. In fact, it‚Äôs the first time Karen and my wife have met üòÉ&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, one of the means I used to entice Karen to visit us was my incessant twittering about food, mwahahaha‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow Natalie is working, and Stephan is exhausted, so we‚Äôll miss church this week while I get things ready for a big lunch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôll probably be getting up at around 7am to start the smoker(s) (I‚Äôve converted my grill to a smoker too), and be occupied with that until close to 2pm when Nat gets home from work, and hopefully the food is ready. I‚Äôm making ribs! St Louis cut spare ribs and baby back ribs!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Karen was gracious enough to help me with the rib prep today. Cutting the spare ribs down to St Louis style ribs and making the rub and then getting all the racks and extra bits seasoned and in the fridge. We (well me at least) had a great time hanging out, talking about everything from their ‚ÄúMONUMENTAL WEDDING!‚Äù to when Natalie and I were thinking about starting a family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since moving to Indiana Natalie and I have become very very close, but we haven‚Äôt made too many friends, so it was really nice to talk to someone else at length, and just hang out all day, being silly, going on a road trip with the dogs (four of them!) to see Stephan, and of course working on the ribs together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, I‚Äôll make sure and post tons of pics tomorrow! I‚Äôm really looking forward to this!&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Rapid Onsite Software Development</title>
    <link href="https://jonmagic.com/posts/rapid-onsite-software-development/"/>
    <updated>2009-06-24T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://jonmagic.com/posts/rapid-onsite-software-development/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;My uncle has been bugging me to help him with writing some software for awhile now, and this last weekend he sent me another email with a new idea, to help him in his business. I had some time available this week, so I decided to drive down to his shop and try something. My goal was to take his simple idea, boil it down to its essence, and write the whole application in a day using &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rubyonrails.com/&quot;&gt;Rails&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To prepare myself I started working on &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development&quot;&gt;TDD&lt;/a&gt; again, using &lt;a href=&quot;http://thoughtbot.com/projects/shoulda/&quot;&gt;shoulda&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://thoughtbot.com/projects/factory_girl&quot;&gt;factory_girl&lt;/a&gt;. I also built my own version of &lt;a href=&quot;http://github.com/fudgestudios/bort/tree/master&quot;&gt;bort&lt;/a&gt; from the ground up, called &lt;a href=&quot;http://github.com/jonmagic/pudding/&quot;&gt;pudding&lt;/a&gt; (it has a couple flavors, including &lt;a href=&quot;http://github.com/jonmagic/pudding/tree/vanilla&quot;&gt;vanilla&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://github.com/jonmagic/pudding/tree/tapioca&quot;&gt;tapioca&lt;/a&gt;). I tried to find the right mix of features to give myself a running start when I arrived onsite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I arrived at 8:30am this morning and started programming at 9am. At first things were going fairly well, building my models out using TDD went fast, and I was rolling along nicely on writing my controllers using TDD when I hit a wall, aka, lack of knowledge on my part. After hitting this wall for 45 minutes I finally gave up on TDD and just went back to my old way of doing things, i.e. no testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was back on a roll again, using my &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jonmagic/webapp_gui/tree&quot;&gt;osx theme&lt;/a&gt; for the admin interface, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.blueprintcss.org/&quot;&gt;blueprint&lt;/a&gt; for the css reset, typography, and layout on the technician facing part of the application (the part that will be used the most).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things were going along nicely until I ran into issues with the way I was doing ajax modals, via &lt;a href=&quot;http://jquery.com/demo/thickbox/&quot;&gt;thickbox&lt;/a&gt;. I‚Äôd already implemented quite a bit using thickbox, when I decided I needed to start over on my modals using a different library. So far I think I‚Äôm gonna use &lt;a href=&quot;http://dev.iceburg.net/jquery/jqModal/&quot;&gt;jqModal&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, at 4:30pm I called it quits for the day, realizing my ‚Äúapp in a day‚Äù dream was not gonna happen, although I believe I‚Äôm about a 1/3rd of the way there, which isn‚Äôt too bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Lessons learned?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I need to work quite a bit more on testing, I need to know it like the back of my hand&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I need to have a sample controller built out in my pudding apps, so I can do a bit of copy/paste when building my controllers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It would also be nice to include my osx theme, and blueprint theme in my pudding apps&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I need to get better at jQuery, and find the best plugins for my different needs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Whiskey Glazed Pork Chops&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1/2 cup Jack Daniel‚Äôs Tennessee whiskey&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1/2 apple cider&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2 tablespoons of light brown sugar&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 tablespoon dijon mustard&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1/8 teaspoon of cayenne pepper&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;4 teaspoons cider vinegar&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;4 bone-in, center-cut pork chops, about 1 inch thick&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2 teaspoons vegetable oil&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;salt and pepper&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 tablespoon unsalted butter&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Whisk together the whiskey, cider, brown sugar, mustard, cayenne, vanilla, and 2 teaspoons of vinegar. Marinate the chops in a quarter (1/4) of this liquid, set aside the rest.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remove chops from the bag, pat dry with paper towels, and discard marinade. Heat up oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat until just starting to smoke. Season the chops with salt and pepper, then throw them in the pan and brown both sides, 2-3 minutes per side. Transfer chops to a plate and cover tightly with foil.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add the rest of the whiskey mix into the skillet and bring to a boil, scraping up any brown bits from the meat. Cook until reduced to a thick glaze, 3 to 5 minutes. Reduce heat to medium-low and drain any juices from the chops plate into the mix. Add 2 teaspoons of cider vinegar, whisk in the butter, and simmer until thick and sticky, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove pan from heat.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Return chops to skillet and let them rest in the pan until sauce clings to them, turning to coat both sides. Leave in there while they finish cooking, about 5 minutes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Country Style Tomatoes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;4 large tomatoes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;8oz of cream cheese&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1/2 teaspoon dried basil&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 garlic clove, minced&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1/4 teaspoon of salt&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;flour&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;bread crumbs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 egg&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 tablespoon of milk&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3 tablespoons of butter&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3 tablespoons of olive oil&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cut each tomato into four thick slices, and then place on paper towels to drain. In a small bowl beat the cream cheese, basil, garlic and salt until blended. Spread mixture onto half the tomato slices and then top with remaining slices.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Place flour and bread crumbs in separate pie pans, in another pan whisk egg and milk. Coat top and bottom of each tomato stack with flour, then egg mixture, and then bread crumbs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In a large skillet, heat butter and oil over medium-high heat. Fry tomato sandwiches in batches for 3-4 minutes on each side or until golden brown. Drain on paper towels and serve.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

    <title>Configuring PBX in a Flash to use Rhino cards</title>

    <id>https://jonmagic.com/posts/configuring-pbx-in-a-flash-to-use-rhino-cards/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;If you are using a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rhinoequipment.com/&quot;&gt;Rhino Equipment card&lt;/a&gt; as your PSTN or digital interface to the telco, and need help setting it up on your Asterisk-based PBX, look no further!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://docs.google.com/View?id=atnp7jn5zpr_95fn6n8bc6&quot;&gt;This google doc&lt;/a&gt; has just the instructions you need. (Thanks to James at Rhino for these great instructions!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, as far as telco cards go, I couldn‚Äôt recommend anyone better than &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rhinoequipment.com/&quot;&gt;Rhino&lt;/a&gt;. Their cards are great, and their technical support is the best I‚Äôve ever had from any company, EVER. They are, simply put, amazing at what they do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh yeah, when it comes to open source PBX platforms, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pbxinaflash.com/&quot;&gt;PBX in a Flash&lt;/a&gt; is the best I‚Äôve found. I‚Äôve tried Asterisk@Home, Trixbox, and a couple others. PiaF is easy to set up, clean, and simple.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Evolution of a twitter client</title>

    <updated>2009-05-22T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://jonmagic.com/posts/evolution-of-a-twitter-client/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;One of my clients wants his employees to be able to use Twitter, but there were some strict requirements involved, and I couldn‚Äôt find a Twitter client for Windows that met all of those requirements, so I decided to write my own Twitter client.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm modeling it after Tweetie for OSX, of course (in look and function). I know Ruby best, so I decided to use &lt;a href=&quot;http://whytheluckystiff.net/&quot;&gt;_why‚Äôs&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://shoooes.net/&quot;&gt;Shoes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://railstips.org/&quot;&gt;John Nunemaker‚Äôs&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://github.com/jnunemaker/twitter/tree/master&quot;&gt;twitter gem&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those interested in writing a Twitter client and using Shoes, or who like to see the evolution of an app, be sure to check out this article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article is going to be updated as I write this app, but I just wanted to start with a slideshow of the evolution of the app so far.&lt;/p&gt;

    <updated>2009-05-16T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://jonmagic.com/posts/first-time-smoking-ribs/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Nat and I smoked pork spare ribs over this Memorial weekend, and they were so yummy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a picture of the rub we made, definitely too intense we found out. We will put together a much simpler one next time. We put the rub on them the night before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://bit.ly/v02eI&quot;&gt;See the recipe here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We smoked the ribs for about 5 hours at 205 to 225 degrees Fahrenheit in my vertical water smoker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here was my smoker setup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After smoking I wrapped them in foil, then wrapped in a warm wet towel, and threw in a cooler for an hour to rest. Finally we threw them on the grill for 2 to 4 minutes, some with just the dry rub they‚Äôd marinated and smoked in, and the rest I threw some store bought bbq sauce on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Natalie made baked beans and potato salad, so we had quite a feast üòÉ&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NOTE:&lt;/strong&gt; Things we‚Äôll do differently next time:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;simpler rub, and less of it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3-2-1 method of cooking, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wyntk.us/food/3-2-1-rib-method.shtml&quot;&gt;see here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;home made bbq sauce&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>Integrating with Quickbooks</title>
    <link href="https://jonmagic.com/posts/integrating-with-quickbooks/"/>
    <updated>2009-04-23T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://jonmagic.com/posts/integrating-with-quickbooks/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;If you are a software developer working on software for small to medium businesses, then there is a 70% chance (my unscientific calculation) that you‚Äôll run into Quickbooks at some point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to integrate with Quickbooks, and especially if you are a developer using ruby, then this post will point you in the right direction for getting things done. So please, read on üòÉ&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DISCLAIMER:&lt;/strong&gt; I am a former associate of Daniel (and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.behindlogic.com/&quot;&gt;BehindLogic&lt;/a&gt;) and I got a freebie for writing this post (which is cool cuz I was gonna write it anyway, but don‚Äôt tell him)‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve been working on writing &lt;a href=&quot;http://jonmagic.com/programming/suite&quot;&gt;software&lt;/a&gt; to manage our small IT consultancy, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sabretechllc.com/&quot;&gt;SabreTech Consulting LLC&lt;/a&gt; and the time came to be able to integrate with our accounting package, Quickbooks. Awhile back we had tried, unsuccessfully, and so I was not looking forward to it this time around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, a friend of mine has been working on writing a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.behindlogic.com/&quot;&gt;Quickbooks gem&lt;/a&gt; and recently released it to the wild, so I thought I would take a crack at the problem again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After getting the gem from him ($199) and the http adapter to sit on our PC that runs quickbooks ($25) I was up and running within minutes. I included the gem in my rails app, fired up my app console, and started creating QB objects and saving them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In about 5 hours of work last week I was able to build an interface to easily link clients in Suite to clients in Quickbooks AND make it so when you create a new client in Suite it can automatically create the client in Quickbooks, and populate the phone/email/address fields. Having completed this in such a short time I was feeling pretty good! Working with Quickbooks wasn‚Äôt a hassle anymore, so I decided that this week I would tackle turning our completed tickets in Suite (work orders) into invoices in Quickbooks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In just 2 days (really fast for me, I‚Äôm a slow slow slow programmer) I had wired up an Invoice model in my rails app, had it creating an invoice in quickbooks and putting in the line items for labor, with quantities and descriptions, setting the thank you message at the bottom of the invoice, and setting the ‚ÄúIsToBePrinted‚Äù field so that our manager can just click on File &amp;gt; Print Forms &amp;gt; Invoices in Quickbooks and turn all those invoices into paper üòÉ&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically I was able to cut down 3 to 5 minutes of work (for our manager) to a button press and 20 to 60 seconds of server work. That is a time savings (via integration) that most businesses would kill to have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, while I‚Äôm super excited about all this, there were some downers (please fix these Dan!):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Documentation is very sparse and sometimes incorrect, I‚Äôve actually offered to help him on it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are some bugs in the gem. One I found was when creating an invoice and setting the quantity field for a line item, it wouldn‚Äôt accept a float, only integers. Daniel replied to my emails within 12 hours, and showed me what to fix in the gem, and said he would fix it soon in the gem and re-release the gem to everyone who had bought it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All said and done, I highly recommend the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.behindlogic.com/&quot;&gt;Quickbooks gem by Daniel Parker of BehindLogic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Running Mephisto (and other Rails apps) on Site5</title>
    <link href="https://jonmagic.com/posts/running-mephisto-and-other-rails-apps-on-site5/"/>
    <updated>2009-04-20T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://jonmagic.com/posts/running-mephisto-and-other-rails-apps-on-site5/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;There are a few steps in getting the latest Mephisto (0.8.2 at the time of this writing) working on the shared host &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.site5.com/&quot;&gt;Site5&lt;/a&gt;. As I‚Äôm writing this Site5 is upgrading all their servers to Ruby 1.8.7, Rails 2.2.2, RubyGems 1.3.1, and Mysql 5.0. Thanks to everyone at Site5 that helped, &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/BenAtSite5&quot;&gt;Ben&lt;/a&gt;, Beau, and the guy I talked to today (forgot his name). Continue reading for the steps I/we had to take to get things running properly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UPDATE:&lt;/strong&gt; Please make sure to update your .htaccess, Site5 now supports mod_rails on most, if not all of their servers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Get your own gems repository working&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ssh to your account and in &lt;code&gt;~/&lt;/code&gt; create a gems dir.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-sh&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-sh&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;mkdir&lt;/span&gt; gems&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;create a .gemrc file in &lt;code&gt;~/&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-sh&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-sh&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;nano&lt;/span&gt; ~/.gemrc&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;paste the following in (changing username to be your user)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-yaml&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-yaml&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;gemhome&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; /home/username/gems
&lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;gempath&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; /home/username/gems
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; /usr/lib/ruby/gems/1.8&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;edit (or create) .bash_profile in &lt;code&gt;~/&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-sh&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-sh&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;nano&lt;/span&gt; ~/.bash_profile&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;paste the following (changing username to be your user)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-sh&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-sh&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token builtin class-name&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token assign-left variable&quot;&gt;GEM_PATH&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;/home/username/gems:/usr/lib/ruby/gems/1.8
&lt;span class=&quot;token builtin class-name&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token assign-left variable&quot;&gt;GEM_HOME&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;/home/username/gems&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now you should be able to run &lt;code&gt;gem environment&lt;/code&gt; and see the correct values.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Downloading Mephisto and getting it setup.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I downloaded the latest release of Mephisto from &lt;a href=&quot;http://mephistoblog.com/download&quot;&gt;http://mephistoblog.com/download&lt;/a&gt;, version 0.8.2 Drax Fixes. Once I had it on my dev machine I scp‚Äôd it up to Site5. There I created an apps dir in &lt;code&gt;~/&lt;/code&gt; on my Site5 account, and untarred mephisto there. I renamed the dir to &lt;code&gt;mephisto_0.8.2&lt;/code&gt; and got to work on configuring stuff. First I copied &lt;code&gt;config/database.example.yml&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;config/database.yml&lt;/code&gt;, went in and deleted all the extra lines, and just configured what I needed. I like to configure my development database, and then for the production one just have it point at the same settings like so:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-yaml&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-yaml&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;development&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;adapter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; mysql
  &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;database&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; username_database
  &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;username&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; username_dbuser
  &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;password&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; password
  &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;host&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; localhost
  &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;encoding&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; utf8

&lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;test&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;adapter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; mysql
  &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;database&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; username_testdatabase
  &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;username&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; username_dbtestuser
  &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;password&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; password
  &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;host&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; localhost
  &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;encoding&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; utf8

&lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;production&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
  development&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve been getting into testing stuff more lately, so I went ahead and configured a test database as well. Remember back at the beginning how we had to setup our own spot for gems? Well now we need to tell this application where to look for those gems, and put our app into production mode. &lt;code&gt;nano config/environment.rb&lt;/code&gt; and set the top five lines to look like this (leave everything else alone in this file, oh, and make sure to replace username with your user):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;# Be sure to restart your web server when you modify this file.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token constant&quot;&gt;ENV&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string-literal&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&#39;GEM_PATH&#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string-literal&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&#39;/home/username/gems:/usr/lib/ruby/gems/1.8&#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;# Uncomment below to force Rails into production mode when&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;# you don&#39;t control web/app server and can&#39;t set it the proper way&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token constant&quot;&gt;ENV&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string-literal&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&#39;RAILS_ENV&#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;||=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string-literal&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&#39;production&#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Preparing dependencies and tell Apache what to do with requests!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point you‚Äôll have to run the following commands inside your &lt;code&gt;mephisto&lt;/code&gt; dir to get our dependencies ready.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-sh&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-sh&quot;&gt;rake config/initializers/session_store.rb
rake gems:install
rake db:bootstrap&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THE FOLLOWING .htaccess STUFF IS OBSOLETE, PLEASE JUMP AHEAD&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you‚Äôve got that done we‚Äôre almost there! The next to last thing is add an &lt;code&gt;.htaccess&lt;/code&gt; file to our public folder so that Apache knows to execute &lt;code&gt;dispatch.fcgi&lt;/code&gt; when a request comes in. So &lt;code&gt;nano public/.htaccess&lt;/code&gt; and paste the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-apache&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-apache&quot;&gt;Options +FollowSymLinks +ExecCGI
RewriteEngine On
RewriteRule ^$ index.html [QSA]
RewriteRule ^([^.]+)$ $1.html [QSA]
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ dispatch.fcgi [QSA,L]
RewriteCond %{HTTP_ACCEPT} application/xrdsxml
RewriteCond %{HTTP_ACCEPT} !application/xrdsxml&#92;s*;&#92;s*q&#92;s*=&#92;s*0(&#92;.0{1,3})?&#92;s*(,|$)
ErrorDocument 500 &quot;&lt;h2&gt;Application error&lt;/h2&gt;Rails application failed to start properly&quot;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OK, NOW THAT Site5 SUPPORTS mod_rails MAKE YOUR .htaccess LOOK LIKE THIS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-apache&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-apache&quot;&gt;PassengerEnabled on&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last but not least we need to go to &lt;code&gt;~/&lt;/code&gt; and rename &lt;code&gt;public_html&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;public_html_old&lt;/code&gt; and then create a symlink like so:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-sh&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-sh&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;ln&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token parameter variable&quot;&gt;-s&lt;/span&gt; ~/apps/mephisto_0.8.2/public public_html&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That‚Äôs it! Open your browser and try to access your site. Things should be working at this point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If it returns &amp;quot;Rails application failed to start properly‚Äù start looking to make sure you have all the gems you need. One thing I like to do is from my mephisto dir, run &lt;code&gt;./script/console&lt;/code&gt; and do a few db lookups, then if that works I run &lt;code&gt;./script/server -e production&lt;/code&gt; and then in a second ssh session to my Site5 account I‚Äôll do a &lt;code&gt;curl http://localhost:3000/&lt;/code&gt; to see what it returns. Often you can see the exact error doing it this way, and fix the problem!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OTHER NOTES:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do not install image_science gem even though mephisto works with it now. Site5 does not install freeimage on their servers, only imagemagick, and the Rmagick gem, so just go with those.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You could automate a lot of this with Capistrano, but if you are only doing it once, why bother? I use Capistrano in a lot in other instances, but was just lazy here üòÉ&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make sure your permissions on your public folder and dispatch.fcgi are set to 755&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

    <title>A little story called fun</title>
    <link href="https://jonmagic.com/posts/a-little-story-called-fun/"/>
    <updated>2009-03-30T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://jonmagic.com/posts/a-little-story-called-fun/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This last weekend I took my wife to Chicago for her birthday, and her best friend flew in from Boston to join us. We had a wonderful weekend, they got to go shopping, we all got to eat amazing food, and I managed to talk them into going to blues and piano joints rather than dance clubs (except for one place that had Jazz upstairs and dancing downstairs).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sunday before taking Michelle to the airport we all went to Ikea so Natalie could do SOME MORE shopping üòÉ Michelle and I were kinda tired, and bored, so while sitting on a very nice leather couch I suggested we play a game. We would co-write a book, taking turns, using our phones and facebook status. The rules were: no more than 255 characters per post (I think Michelle‚Äôs was limited to 140), and no colluding. So basically we didn‚Äôt set up the story in any way, it just worked itself out as we went along.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The game ended up being tremendously fun, and got us through the better part of the day, including an hour or two of the time Michelle had to spend in the airport, because her flight was delayed. Because we were doing this on facebook, and it would only make sense if you were friends with BOTH of us and saw the updates coming in sync, a lot of people thought we were absolutely off our rockers. In fact, this comment to Michelle from her friend pretty much sums up what it must have looked like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DeAnna: sometimes i read your status updates and think you are on crack.
i think a crackberry is bad for someone already addicted to crack‚Ä¶.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;p.s. i would have called you this weekend, but clearly you are having fun with your bffs. and taking lots of crack. so later this week?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you were one of those people only getting half the story, I‚Äôve included the whole thing if you click thru to read the rest of this post üòÉ Enjoy&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Beginning&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2:20pm Jonathan woke to the phone ringing. Ok ok he thought, and slid his finger across the face of the iphone to answer it&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2:22pm Michelle was on the other end of the line, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs it Jonny-Boy, we‚Äôre done for‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2:25pm Jonathan jerked the rest of the way to consciousness. ‚Äúwhat!‚Äù he screamed! ‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt stop the package in time?‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2:28pm Michelle , stunned by Jon‚Äôs reaction lost composure &amp;quot; ME?? ME not stop the package in time!!! since when was that my responsibility you‚Ä¶hold on, another call&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2:49pm Jonathan started racking his brain, when had he ever taken responsibility‚Ä¶ Didn‚Äôt matter, the cat was almost out of the bag, and there was nothing he could do about it, short of storming the courier service and going Jack Bauer on em&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2:52pm Michelle clicked back onto the line ‚Äúsorry about that it was Z and he is &lt;strong&gt;NOT&lt;/strong&gt; happy we‚Äôve gotta get down there like now‚Äù she finished as she climbed out of bed&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3:01pm Jonathan said ‚Äúmeet you in 15, corner of le salle and ohio‚Äù and he hung up. Throwing some clothes on he grabbed the already packed bag and bolted for the door. He never looked back, but couldn‚Äôt help but think as he raced down the steps that that was the last time he would see his apartment on the north side&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3:05pm Michelle jumped into her Mini that the driver had brought around ‚Äúthank you marcus‚Äù she umbled as she climbed in and slammed on the gas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3:12pm Jonathan neared the corner, and saw her mini zipping east on Ohio towards him. To his left he heard an suv accelorate, and instantly knew things were about to go very wrong&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3:17pm Michelle saw Jon walking down the street and thought ‚Äúdamn hippies‚Äù and threw the wheel to the right and slammed on the breaks inches in front of him,he looked worried.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3:41pm Michelle looked at the silent Jon ‚Äúhello! what‚Äôs wrong with you? you‚Äôre not talking now? get in we need to hurry‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3:39pm Jonathan jumped in and grumbled something about company coming ‚Äúin like 2 seconds‚Äù and that they probably weren‚Äôt here to play nice&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3:48pm Michelle looked to the left and saw the &lt;strong&gt;SUV&lt;/strong&gt; reeling around to backtrack at them ‚Äúugh. again?‚Äù she said throwing the mini into first and peeling out ‚Äúany idea who?‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4:02pm Jonathan said &amp;quot;well I‚Äôm guessing it‚Äôs not one of my ex girlfriends&amp;quot;he twisted his head around and saw three heads through the windshield of the approaching suburban and they definately looked Spanish&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4:04pm Michelle looked at him. ‚Äúspanish? you think that you can tell someoines exact &lt;strong&gt;NATIONALITY&lt;/strong&gt; from a hundred yards away in a soeeding car? gimmee a break!‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4:05pm Michelle kept her eyes on the road, ‚Äúlook let‚Äôs just get to Z without incident and figure out who the hell they are then. got your passport?‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4:08pm Jonathan said ‚Äúwhich one?any idea where we might be going? I just hope Z gets us outta here sooner rather than later. And I don‚Äôt care if I ever see Chicago again‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4:32pm Michelle glanced in the mirror and saw they had lost the &lt;strong&gt;SUV&lt;/strong&gt;, ‚Äúgood question. call Z let‚Äôs find out what the hells going on‚Äù she said as they pulled up to the terminal&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4:43pm Jonathan picked up his phone and dialed.‚Äúz, where we goin‚Äô?we gotta get out of here fast!‚Äù ‚ÄúSophia? Ok, whatever.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4:50pm Michelle looked at Jon blankly &amp;quot;sophia? really this day keeps getting stranger and stranger. guess we‚Äôre the‚Ä¶ Walshes then. Lee and Lea brother and sister again. C‚Äômon&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4:57pm Jonathan grabbed the bags and plastered a smile on his face. ‚Äúyou know, the more I think about it, those thugs may have had something to do with an ex, I think her family was connected in certain parts of Europe where the Spanish might have power.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5:01pm Michelle laughed and slipped on her glasses ‚Äúright your long line of European exes‚Ä¶ Spanish exes‚Äù shaking her head they walked inside ignoring the cries of the bellman&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5:07pm Jonathan stayed cheery as they grabbed their tickets at the lufthansa counter. ‚ÄúOur connections in Frankfurt, maybe we can grab a pint while we‚Äôre there.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5:17pm Michelle nodded in egar agreement, they quickly passed through security and took two seats in the lounge. just as she was about to nodd off she heard a familar voice&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5:23pm Jonathan didn‚Äôt even turn around as Z began to berate them them from where he was seated. ‚Äúyou guys are getting sloppy, someone want to explain why that recording is on it‚Äôs way to the PM right now?‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5:27pm Michelle whipped around ‚Äúdamn it Z! you know if you‚Äôd quit hiring rookie couriers we wouldn‚Äôt be in this mess! I told you we couldn‚Äôt trust that kid‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5:37pm Jonathan interjected, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt see how this is helping, the damage has been done. All we can hope is that Obama‚Äôs staff find the traitors in time and bring the operation down.‚Äù ‚Äúin the meantime I suggest you tell us what our next assignment is.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5:42pm Michelle glared at jon for a brief second then decided he was right and looked to Z for the answers &amp;quot;look I dont know anymore than that you both need to be on that plane&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5:47pm Jonathan wondered if this had anything to do with Petrov, it had been 5 years since they last worked together, and hadn‚Äôt he gone civ and back to his home country? No matter, the announcement came over the speaker that it was time to board&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5:51pm Michelle gathered her bag and headed to the plane. this wa s always her favorite part- the calm before the storm, the plan before the chase. she couldn wait to land&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5:56pm Jonathan fell asleep before the wheels left the ground, waking only when ‚Äúsis‚Äù shook him because she was bored. ‚Äúwudda you want?‚Äù he grunted at her&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5:59pm Michelle looked down at him. &amp;quot; do you think‚Ä¶no. sorry&amp;quot; he glared at her&amp;quot;what?&amp;quot; he asked annoyed ‚Äúdo you think that Petrov might be involved? I know its crazy but‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6:03pm Jonathan perked up a bit, ‚Äúyeah that‚Äôs the first thing that came to my mind! But why would he need us? We‚Äôre mostly just the Company‚Äôs grifters.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6:06pm Michelle nodded in excitement, ‚Äúmaybe our time has finally come! I mean we‚Äôve been schleping with intelligence for 6 years, maybe they‚Äôre moving us up!‚Äù. she babbled&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6:14pm Jonathan snickered, ‚Äúoh does lanky lea wanna be a double 0?‚Äù ‚Äúthat‚Äôs so cute‚Äù‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6:21pm Michelle punched Jon in the arm and rolled over to go back asleep secretly hoping that she would be&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6:30pm Jonathan checked their next boarding passes as they exited the plane, ‚Äúlooks like we‚Äôve got about 8 hours to kill. Wanna go to that one place where we met that one guy that one time, you know, the guy with the dog?‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The End&lt;/h3&gt;

    <updated>2009-02-28T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://jonmagic.com/posts/we-have-crossed-the-border/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;When I first got started in computers professionally (while still in highschool) I never dreamed I would be a partner in a company that did business internationally. Before I tell that story let me give you some background.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am a partner in a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sabretechllc.com/&quot;&gt;small IT consultancy&lt;/a&gt; based out of southern Michigan. My first partner (Brad) and I bought SabreTech Consulting LLC from an old friend of mine in the summer of 2005. We‚Äôve been selling and servicing computers for businesses and individuals since then, doing our best to make sure the customer comes first. In 2007 Sam joined us (and became a partner in 2008) and we continued to expand into northern Indiana and Ohio. Business has been great, we‚Äôve even purchased a new (and bigger) building in Michigan and moved our retail location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this week things really got interesting. One of my clients in Hillsdale asked me if I could help his friend in France. I said sure, so he gave me her email address and I setup a meeting. Tuesday her and I skyped, and then started a remote connection so I could fix her computer. How cool is that! SabreTech Remote Connection from Elkhart Indiana to Versailles France üòÉ&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later I was bragging about my remote to Sam, and he was kind enough to inform me that one of our clients that buys custom embedded systems from us was sending our equipment all over the world, Canada, Peru, Ireland, and Egypt!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God has blessed me with an amazing wife, family, business partners, and now an international business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Except for putting my back out, it‚Äôs been a great week üòÉ&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Moving to Disqus for comments</title>
    <link href="https://jonmagic.com/posts/moving-to-disqus-for-comments/"/>
    <updated>2009-02-21T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://jonmagic.com/posts/moving-to-disqus-for-comments/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve been thinking about using Disqus for awhile now and finally decided to bite the bullet when I realized I just couldn‚Äôt get the features I wanted out of Mephisto‚Äôs built in comment system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Setting &lt;a href=&quot;http://disqus.com/&quot;&gt;Disqus&lt;/a&gt; up on your blog is easy enough, they‚Äôve got automated stuff for the popular hosted blogging platforms, and easy to insert html/js for those of us running our own custom blogging systems, like &lt;a href=&quot;http://mephistoblog.com/&quot;&gt;Mephisto&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are interested in doing this yourself, read on!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to be able to keep the 90+ comments I had already though, and importing didn‚Äôt look like it was going to be easy. But then I found &lt;a href=&quot;http://gweezlebur.com/2009/01/05/mephisto-to-disqus.html&quot;&gt;Michael Ivy‚Äôs post on importing from Mephisto to Disqus&lt;/a&gt; and got excited at how easy it looked to be. At first I tried using his vanilla script, just filling in the blanks, but quickly realized there were some problems:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The script didn‚Äôt account for your MySQL db having a password&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It gets the article URLs from the article RSS feed, which only returns the last 15 articles by default&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started tackling the first problem by just changing one line in the script to look like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ruby&quot;&gt;db &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; Sequel&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;mysql&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;db&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token symbol&quot;&gt;:user&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&gt;&lt;/span&gt; db_user&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token symbol&quot;&gt;:password&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&gt;&lt;/span&gt; db_pass&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token symbol&quot;&gt;:host&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string-literal&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&#39;localhost&#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and then adding &lt;code&gt;db_pass = &#39;password_here&#39;&lt;/code&gt; to the options stuff above. This kind of worked, except that one of the last lines in the script&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ruby&quot;&gt;puts &lt;span class=&quot;token string-literal&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;Success: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token delimiter punctuation&quot;&gt;#{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token content&quot;&gt;comment&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;author&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token delimiter punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt; on &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token interpolation&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token delimiter punctuation&quot;&gt;#{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token content&quot;&gt;comment&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token delimiter punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;errored out on &lt;code&gt;comment.author&lt;/code&gt;, because Sequel isn‚Äôt taking into account relationships between models in Mephisto.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point I decided to rework it a little and just use &lt;code&gt;./script/runner&lt;/code&gt; to run the export script, so that I could take full advantage of the Rails app relationships. &lt;a href=&quot;http://gist.github.com/68198&quot;&gt;Here is my updated script&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things still weren‚Äôt quite right though, I either had to modify Mephisto to get back all my articles from the RSS feed, or just use ActiveRecord to pull all that stuff. I decided to edit &lt;code&gt;app/controllers/feed_controller.rb&lt;/code&gt; and remove the &lt;code&gt;:limit =&amp;gt; 15&lt;/code&gt; lines from the three methods at the bottom of that controller. I put them back afterwards üòÉ&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That should be it, worked great for me, putting all my existing comments into Disqus. Then I just had to modify &lt;code&gt;_comments.liquid&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;_entry.liquid&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;layout.liquid&lt;/code&gt; using the built in template editor in Mephisto.&lt;/p&gt;

Today around noon we reached 41 degrees, the sun was out, and it just felt amazing outside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To celebrate I cleaned out my car üòÉ&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then at 3pm we took the dogs for a walk‚Äîonly Bailey‚Äôs second walk, and his first to the park. When we got home, Natalie gave Bailey a bath in the sink while I gave Leo a bath in the tub (first time doing each of them alone; quite a trick). Now I‚Äôm grilling outside, with sandals on!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm sure next week the temperature will be back down in the teens, but I can‚Äôt help but get excited.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Wow, I must have more friends this year than ever! Several friends called to wish me a happy birthday, I got 10 happy bday text messages, and about 20 emails!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So anyways, thank you everyone, it was a great birthday. I actually took the day off, the first time since before college I remember not working or taking exams on my bday (except for that one time our prof brought us into class for the exam, and then told us all we got an A and to have a nice day).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This morning I went Christmas shopping for my wife and my sister. Then this afternoon/evening I smoked a chicken out in the garage. Tina (my lil‚Äôsis) showed up a bit after four and she chilled in the garage with me for a couple hours. At 7pm Nat got home from work and we skyped with mom and dad and had a mini-birthday/Christmas party. Since this was our only chance for all of us to get together (virtually) we opened gifts and just had a wonderful time. After that we had an amazing dinner together and watched a movie. To top it off we had Tiramisu that Natalie made‚Ä¶ mmm, good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past I haven‚Äôt always looked forward to my birthday. From now on, I think I will.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Globe Gravity Feed Slicer</title>
    <link href="https://jonmagic.com/posts/globe-gravity-feed-slicer/"/>
    <updated>2008-11-22T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://jonmagic.com/posts/globe-gravity-feed-slicer/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This is a post from my old blog that I‚Äôve put up for solidarity. To this day I still get emails from people inquiring about this model slicer üòÉ&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About a year before my parents headed to South America they started getting rid of most of the stuff they‚Äôd accumulated over the years. One of the last things they gifted to Natalie and I was a meat slicer that looked pretty beat up and rusty, but had promise for anyone willing to take the time to take it apart and restore it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs been sitting in my garage for several months now, collecting dust and more rust. But last weekend, as part of my meat smoking tradition (started about 6 weeks ago, see older posts for fun smoking adventures), I decided I wanted to thinly slice the meat I smoked, and I‚Äôm not very good at thinly slicing meat with a knife, so I needed something more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I dug the meat slicer out of the corner of the garage, carried it inside (without putting out my back!) and got to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started by taking it apart, a bit of a challenge the first time, but I‚Äôm sure it will be easier in the future now that I know what I‚Äôm doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are all the individual parts laid out on my counter ready to go into the dishwasher. Oh yeah, I also used a toothbrush and baking soda to scrub the rusty spots and remove about 90% of the rust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the parts were in the dishwasher I started researching this slicer. A Globe Gravity Feed Slicer, Model #150, Serial #223739.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Couldn‚Äôt find much on the internet, other than &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.globeslicers.com/site/default.asp&quot;&gt;Globe‚Äôs Website&lt;/a&gt;, and that they are located in Dayton Ohio. They did have contact info on their website though, so I shot them an email asking if they could tell me more about my slicer, and if they had any manuals or accessories for this thing lying around in a warehouse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the parts were done in the dishwasher I put it back together and my did it look good!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used it to slice my smoked beef shoulder roast that night (that‚Äôs a whole other story, 14 hours on the smoker + 2 hours in the oven crazy) and also sliced some cheese, onion, and bread. It works beautifully, really quite cool. The only problem now is figuring out where to put it üòÉ&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One last thing: Globe did email me the following Monday, and explained that the current owners bought Globe in 1993, and did not have anything from this old model slicer around. They did tell me though that it was manufactured in 1949.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;http://behindlogic.com/&quot;&gt;Daniel&lt;/a&gt; for creating a &lt;a href=&quot;http://github.com/dcparker/jquery_plugins/tree/master/quickselect&quot;&gt;nifty new jquery&lt;/a&gt; plugin for me! &lt;a href=&quot;http://github.com/dcparker/jquery_plugins/tree/master/quickselect&quot;&gt;Quickselect&lt;/a&gt; takes select/option tags in HTML and turns them into an input box with live search, and can even use the &lt;a href=&quot;http://rails-oceania.googlecode.com/svn/lachiecox/qs_score/trunk/qs_score.js&quot;&gt;quicksilver.js&lt;/a&gt; for more interesting search results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I needed this for Suite, the software I‚Äôm writing to manage my company &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sabretechllc.com/&quot;&gt;SabreTech&lt;/a&gt;, and I could not for the life of me find a jQuery plugin that did something nifty like this. I had found this &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pengoworks.com/workshop/jquery/autocomplete.htm&quot;&gt;autocomplete&lt;/a&gt; plugin, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://ejohn.org/blog/jquery-livesearch/&quot;&gt;this live search&lt;/a&gt; plugin (which was actually a rewrite of another plugin by a friend of mine, &lt;a href=&quot;http://orderedlist.com/articles/live-search-with-quicksilver-style-for-jquery&quot;&gt;John Nunemaker&lt;/a&gt;)‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I asked Dan to write this up for us yesterday, and this afternoon he found some time and put it together, and guess what, it works &lt;strong&gt;PERFECTLY&lt;/strong&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, I hope others find this useful‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Ok, so last weekend I totally botched the brisket. It was slightly edible, more like a steak than anything I guess, but a really, really tough steak. So, rather than give up I‚Äôm getting right back on that horse till I can ride thru to the end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, being like my father, I‚Äôm not going to settle for mediocre tools. My smoker only came with a simple thermometer in it that says Warm ‚Äì Ideal ‚Äì Hot, with no temperatures in degrees on it. I could have just gone and bought an $8 oven thermometer and attached it, but I thought I‚Äôd get something a bit cooler and take my time installing it üòÉ&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs easiest to tell this story with pictures, so here goes. This first pic is the Brinkman el-cheapo smoker pre-mods.

&lt;p&gt;Next up are the tools and parts I used (minus the bandsaw).

&lt;p&gt;Here is the chunk-o-wood I cut with the bandsaw.

&lt;p&gt;Next I clamped on my chunk of wood and drilled holes for my bolts, then I bolted it on, and finally drilled a couple holes for the thermometer probe.

&lt;p&gt;I inserted the Maverick wireless thermometer probe and put on the grate.
&lt;img src=&quot;https://jonmagic.com/images/posts/temperature-time/2993413134_3ca3c366bf_m.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;You&#39;ve been probed&quot; title=&quot;You&#39;ve been probed&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And last but not least here it is with everything installed and the transmitter and receiver running.
&lt;img src=&quot;https://jonmagic.com/images/posts/temperature-time/2993415836_971e9c1a46.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;We have transmission&quot; title=&quot;We have transmission&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hopefully tomorrow night I‚Äôll be able to blog a good report about my next brisket. This one is 4 pounds and purchased from a local butcher rather than from the grocery store. Here‚Äôs to hoping!&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Two weekends ago Natalie bought us a smoker (for smoking meat you silly). This weekend I will complete the trifecta of smoking. The first weekend we smoked pork using &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/alton-brown/pulled-pork-recipe/index.html&quot;&gt;this recipe&lt;/a&gt; in order to make pulled pork sandwiches, last weekend we smoked a chicken using &lt;a href=&quot;http://getyourgrillon.net/2008/04/21/bite-through-smoked-chicken-skin/&quot;&gt;this recipe&lt;/a&gt; and it was amazing, and this weekend I will complete the trifecta by smoking a beef brisket using &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thesmokerking.com/page1a.html&quot;&gt;this recipe&lt;/a&gt; (please see the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thesmokerking.com/beefrub.html&quot;&gt;rub&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thesmokerking.com/page7b.html&quot;&gt;mop&lt;/a&gt; as well) from the smoker king himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know, I know, I haven‚Äôt done ribs yet. But I will have done pork, chicken, and beef, so I believe we‚Äôll meet the dictionary description of a trifecta:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚Äúa run of three wins or grand events‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>OSX Styled web gui</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôll probably get in trouble for this, but I decided to &lt;a href=&quot;http://github.com/jonmagic/webapp_gui/&quot;&gt;release it&lt;/a&gt; anyways‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve been working on some software for running my company and needed a nice GUI, implemented in HTML/CSS/JS. I decided, since I prefer using OSX over any other interface, I wanted my web app to look like OSX too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I started from scratch and made up this GUI using minimal HTML markup, simple CSS (I use the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.blueprintcss.org/&quot;&gt;blueprint&lt;/a&gt; CSS library as a foundation), the &lt;a href=&quot;http://jquery.com/&quot;&gt;jquery&lt;/a&gt; JavaScript library (including jQuery UI elements), and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.famfamfam.com/lab/icons/silk/&quot;&gt;famfamfam silk&lt;/a&gt; icon set.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not &lt;strong&gt;TOTALLY&lt;/strong&gt; OSX themed, as I couldn‚Äôt find any tabs anywhere in OSX that worked for web apps (at least not easily implemented ones), so I used the jQuery tabs instead and just made them match as close as possible to the rest of the theme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Caveat&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will not work in IE (I‚Äôm pretty sure, but haven‚Äôt tested), but it does work in modern versions of WebKit-based browsers (Safari and Chrome) and Firefox.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While nothing really jumps out, here are a few things that I enjoy doing and do a lot:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My job, fixing people‚Äôs computers, making people happy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My family, doing all the little things that make Natalie happy, even if she doesn‚Äôt realize it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Programming, for fun, for work, for side projects&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>Summer in a nutshell</title>

    <id>https://jonmagic.com/posts/summer-in-a-nutshell/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Last year I got married. Natalie and I had bought a house in Elkhart, Indiana, and we moved there the same week we married and have been making a home here since then. My memory is so bad I can‚Äôt remember what we did last fall, winter, or spring, but I do remember most of this summer üòÉ&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Natalie started a new job this summer and is loving it. Late spring I picked up a bad habit, gaming, and it has stuck with me through the summer. More notable is our vacation in June, where my brother-in-law and sister-in-law came up to stay with us, and we rocked Elkhart AND Chicago üòÉ&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the most important thing that happened this summer in our lives wasn‚Äôt even something that happened directly to us. My parents finally got all their support (to become missionaries), spent a couple months getting ready, and flew to Argentina to start new lives as church planters (these events did not necessarily happen in that order). This has affected us though‚Äînow neither Natalie nor I have parents close by. The closest immediate relative is my sister, an hour away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As summer closes up we reflect. It was a good summer, full of life changes, some surprises, many blessings, and a few hard times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Sequence of events:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;June 19th&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;10pm EST ‚Äì hacker figured out my email password, logged in, and sent out a mass email to the top 20 people on my contact list (most contacted people), thankfully gmail calculates this list only when you use the web interface in gmail, which I haven‚Äôt used in quite some time since I switched to using Apple Mail.app. Most everyone on the top 20 were family or friends. Mysteriously the hacker does not send the mass mail to Sam or Xian, who were both on my top 20 list. The two people who would have known to call me (rather than email me) and tell me to take immediate action.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;10:16pm EST ‚Äì Hacker? tries logging into my blog admin section from this ip 90.194.192.57 unsuccessfully&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;10:20pm EST ‚Äì Hacker? successfully logs into my blog admin section from this ip 88.191.47.11&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;10:23pm EST ‚Äì Magically whoever logged in at 10:20 is now logged in under a different ip 128.197.11.30 and figuring out my blogging system&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;10:29pm EST ‚Äì Hacker figures out my layout management system and starts adding javascript to my template files, first my tag.liquid file&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;10:31pm EST ‚Äì Hacker finds my layout.liquid file, the master layout, and adds several javascript lines in there. They cause anyone who visits my site to get forwarded to a nasty porn storm site, and installed some sort of tracking js linked to &lt;a href=&quot;http://cetrk.com/&quot;&gt;cetrk.com&lt;/a&gt; and crazyegg?

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Man, I was just thinking the other day about all the content I‚Äôve lost over the years switching blogging platforms. Then I listened to a podcast (most likely from Leo Laporte‚Äôs &lt;a href=&quot;http://twit.tv/&quot;&gt;TWIT&lt;/a&gt; network) and found out about the &lt;a href=&quot;http://archive.org/&quot;&gt;WayBackMachine&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&quot;http://archive.org/&quot;&gt;archive.org&lt;/a&gt;‚Ä¶ I know I‚Äôve heard of it before but always thought ‚Äúwhat is that good for anyway???‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well today I checked it out, and all &lt;a href=&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/*/http://jonmagic.com&quot;&gt;my blog posts from 2004 and 2005&lt;/a&gt; are on there üòÉ
There are tons of other sites I‚Äôve lost, most of which I probably won‚Äôt ever find not because the way back machine doesn‚Äôt have them, but because I can‚Äôt remember the URLs‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, it was just fun reading some of the stuff I wrote a few years ago. I actually sounded smarter back then üòõ&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve been using laptops for almost 7 years now, which means I haven‚Äôt really had the need for a desk in the last 7 years (I travel a lot for my job). I‚Äôve been building my gaming rig over the last 2 months (since I‚Äôve only started gaming again in the last few months) and it‚Äôs been living on an old dining room table in one of our bedrooms upstairs. While functional, it‚Äôs kinda wobbly and just doesn‚Äôt have the look and feel I want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So today I started building a desk from scratch (well, from wood actually). It‚Äôs gonna be a nice corner desk with one side dedicated to my gaming rig and the other side for my laptop and work related stuff (i.e. printer etc)‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôll post photos of my current setup and then my new desk as building progresses. All I‚Äôve started today is the tower cabinet that will hold the gaming rig; basic construction is done and trim has been cut but not attached.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Ok, so that‚Äôs not quite true, I did play some Counter-Strike and stuff last year, but last night and today I really got back into gaming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What better way to get back into things than play &lt;a href=&quot;http://orange.half-life2.com/portal.html&quot;&gt;Portal&lt;/a&gt; by Valve‚Ä¶ Part of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://orange.half-life2.com/index.html&quot;&gt;Orange Box&lt;/a&gt; this game is a strategy game from a first person perspective, and it was fantastic‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôve ever enjoyed a game that much. The story was simple but interesting, the narrator/boss was hilarious, and it had the best game ending I‚Äôve ever seen (I kinda knew how good the ending was before I played it though cuz of Jonathan Coultan‚Äôs jump into fame).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, I guess Wednesday Xian is going to get me into Team Fortress 2 which he plays a lot and speaks very highly of‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok, so I‚Äôm upset because I wanted a new laptop, and they didn‚Äôt come out with one I want. Guess I‚Äôll have to wait for the MacBook Pro updates.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Capistrano recipe and howto for Rails, Mongrel, and Nginx</title>
    <link href="https://jonmagic.com/posts/capistrano-recipe-and-howto-for-rails-mongrel-and-nginx/"/>
    <updated>2008-01-10T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://jonmagic.com/posts/capistrano-recipe-and-howto-for-rails-mongrel-and-nginx/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;h3&gt;UPDATE: This is outdated due to the release of Capistrano 2‚Ä¶ I will work on a new tutorial as soon as I have a project I need to deploy‚Ä¶ 1-10-08&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All righty then. Recently my firm (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sabretechllc.com/&quot;&gt;SabreTech&lt;/a&gt;) got a contract to write and deploy a fairly complicated web app for a local business. Immediately I asked my friend &lt;a href=&quot;http://mintchaos.com/&quot;&gt;Xian&lt;/a&gt; to give me some deployment ideas, and he suggested I use &lt;a href=&quot;http://nginx.net/&quot;&gt;nginx&lt;/a&gt; as my web server instead of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apache.org/&quot;&gt;Apache&lt;/a&gt; as well as &lt;a href=&quot;http://slicehost.com/&quot;&gt;Slicehost&lt;/a&gt; as my vps host provider‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I set up my Slicehost account and started hacking. About a week later (five hours of work snuck in here and there), I‚Äôve got my vps up and running smoothly. I‚Äôve been using &lt;a href=&quot;http://weblog.jamisbuck.org/2006/3/6/switchtower-renamed&quot;&gt;Capistrano&lt;/a&gt; for deployment for awhile, but I also wanted to use it to set up my server, and that is when I ran across deprec. &lt;a href=&quot;http://deprec.rubyforge.org/&quot;&gt;Deprec&lt;/a&gt; is a nice little gem with a ton of capistrano recipes for setting up and deploying a server. It had some great recipes for deploying to &lt;a href=&quot;http://ubuntu.org/&quot;&gt;Ubuntu&lt;/a&gt;, so I chose Ubuntu as my OS for my new slice (vps).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I just had to write some of my own recipes for setting up and deploying with Nginx instead of Apache. That is where most of my time was spent. Below you‚Äôll find my instructions and recipes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Prerequisites&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Install the capistrano and deprec gems on your development machine&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cap your app; in the root of your app dir, run: &lt;code&gt;cap -A&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set up deprec: from the root of your app, run &lt;code&gt;deprec_dotfiles&lt;/code&gt; which just creates a file in your user dir called &lt;code&gt;.caprc&lt;/code&gt;, which contains the following line:
&lt;code&gt;require &#39;deprec/recipes&#39;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your server must be running ubuntu (it should work on any debian based OS though)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your svn repository must be accessible by the same user listed in your &lt;code&gt;deploy.rb&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://jonmagic.com/assets/2008/1/10/nginx.conf.txt&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;nginx.conf&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;code&gt;database.yml.production&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;deploy.rb&lt;/code&gt; must exist and be configured in &lt;code&gt;app/config&lt;/code&gt; (and checked into your repository)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You need to take &lt;a href=&quot;http://jonmagic.com/assets/2008/1/10/jonmagic_recipes.txt&quot;&gt;this file&lt;/a&gt; and append the contents to the bottom of your &lt;code&gt;config/deploy.rb&lt;/code&gt; (these are the recipes I wrote)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make sure and configure the mongrel settings in your &lt;code&gt;deploy.rb&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Instructions&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Log into your server as root and add a new user (the user you specify in your &lt;code&gt;deploy.rb&lt;/code&gt;), set the password, and finally add to sudoers file
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;useradd -m bobby&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;passwd bobby&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;visudo&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;From the root of your app run:
&lt;code&gt;cap install_rails_stack_with_nginx&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The last one takes a while, but when it is done run:
&lt;code&gt;cap svn_cache_credentials&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finally run:
&lt;code&gt;cap deploy_first_time&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(When it asks for mysql user password just press enter, unless you changed the mysql root password)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Files&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://jonmagic.com/assets/2008/1/10/nginx.conf.txt&quot;&gt;nginx.conf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://jonmagic.com/assets/2008/1/10/jonmagic_recipes.txt&quot;&gt;my recipes, add to bottom of deploy.rb&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    <title>Ultimate media/backup server</title>
    <link href="https://jonmagic.com/posts/ultimate-mediabackup-server/"/>
    <updated>2007-10-22T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://jonmagic.com/posts/ultimate-mediabackup-server/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve been using a winxp box in my living room for some time now, and while it works really well, I do find it lacking. Currently it has a 200gb hdd and a 80gb hdd, runs xp pro, has a video card with composite out so I can go straight to the tv, has &lt;a href=&quot;http://azureus.sourceforge.net/&quot;&gt;Azureus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rulecam.net/ted/&quot;&gt;ted&lt;/a&gt; to get tv shows,
&lt;a href=&quot;http://filehippo.com/download_klite_codec_pack/&quot;&gt;k-lite codec pack&lt;/a&gt; with Media Player Classic, and vnc so I can remote control it‚Ä¶ Its pretty slick over all, but I‚Äôm running out of storage and I want something with more features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;So here are my new requirements:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Easily expandable storage, without reinstalling my OS or adding RAID cards etc‚Ä¶&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Smaller form factor, my current machine is a full desktop tower&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;IR remote control and VNC&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;auto download shows&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;act as a backup resource for all my computers in the house, which means it has to have redundant storage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;looks pretty, both hardware and software&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Well, the only way I know how to meet those requirements is with a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apple.com/macmini/&quot;&gt;Mac Mini&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.drobo.com/&quot;&gt;Drobo&lt;/a&gt; storage device.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;How I‚Äôll pimp the Mac Mini&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôll need at least a gig of RAM in the mini, doesn‚Äôt matter how big its HDD is though since the Drobo will be plugged into it. I‚Äôll run Leopard with &lt;a href=&quot;http://azureus.sourceforge.net/&quot;&gt;Azureus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rulecam.net/ted/&quot;&gt;ted&lt;/a&gt; to get my TV content. I‚Äôll set up AFP and SMB file sharing on it so I can access this baby over the network. I‚Äôm not sure yet how I‚Äôll remote control, might use VNC, might not???&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;What I‚Äôll do with the Drobo&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The drobo will be attached to the mini via USB 2.0. I‚Äôll probably start with a few 250gb or 500gb drives, doesn‚Äôt matter cuz of the drobo‚Äôs magic!!! With the advent of Leopard and Time Machine I‚Äôll be able to set this as a backup drive over the network for all my Macs, never having to worry about data loss again! I‚Äôm so excited about this part of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, there are more details to figure out, and of course I need to find funding üòâ But one can always wish can‚Äôt they‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Setting up a Mac</title>
    <link href="https://jonmagic.com/posts/setting-up-a-mac/"/>
    <updated>2007-08-15T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://jonmagic.com/posts/setting-up-a-mac/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Ok, I‚Äôve setup quite a few Macs for friends and clients, tweaking things (even starting with a fresh install and only installing the necessary components, without any extra bloat), installing useful utilities, and arranging things to maximize workflow. I unfortunately have not recorded this process to date and a good friend of mine needs to reinstall his OS and set everything up due to a hard drive crash, so I guess now is finally the time to write down all the steps‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 1:&lt;/strong&gt;
When installing OS X make sure to click on any buttons that say ‚Äúoptions‚Äù or ‚Äúcustomize.‚Äù The first install screen that gives you one of these will ask if you want to install over top, or wipe and reinstall. I usually use the wipe option. The second screen that gives you one of these two buttons, if you click it, will let you remove all the extra programs you don‚Äôt need. I start by unchecking the box on printer drivers, unchecking fonts, unchecking languages, and then I pick through the extras, usually removing stuff like GarageBand, etc. Once you‚Äôve got things tweaked, start the install (you can also skip the media check that it runs)‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 2:&lt;/strong&gt;
Some techies say you should create an admin account and then a locked down user account to run in on a daily basis. I find this a nuisance, so I just create my one user on the initial install, make sure I assign a password, and that‚Äôs that. If you have security concerns, go to your System Preferences, then to Accounts, click on Login Options, and tell it not to auto login that user.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 3:&lt;/strong&gt;
Run all your system updates: click on the Apple in the upper left, then click Software Update.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 4:&lt;/strong&gt;
Create a Downloads folder in your home directory or on your desktop, then open Safari and go to the Safari Preferences and set the default download location to that folder. Otherwise downloads go to your desktop and clutter things up real quick. This is a personal preference of course, so do what you will. Also, remove unnecessary icons on your dock and drag a shortcut to your home folder onto the dock (next to your garbage can &lt;strong&gt;NOT ON IT&lt;/strong&gt;!) and also drag your Applications folder onto your dock, next to the home folder shortcut you just put there üòÉ On Macs shortcuts are technically called Aliases, but whateva‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 5:&lt;/strong&gt;
Tweak Safari a little more by going to Safari Preferences and unchecking the ‚ÄúOpen Safe Files after downloading.‚Äù Also, I think in older versions of Safari you had to enable Tabbed browsing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 6:&lt;/strong&gt;
Disable Spotlight hot keys by clicking the Apple in the upper left, then click on System Preferences, then go to Spotlight, and on the first tab uncheck both the boxes at the bottom. You will need to do this so you can map &lt;code&gt;CMD-Space&lt;/code&gt; as Quicksilver‚Äôs hot key later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 7:&lt;/strong&gt;
Download your useful utilities and programs‚Ä¶ Fire up Safari and start with these great programs:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://quicksilver.blacktree.net/&quot;&gt;Quicksilver&lt;/a&gt; is an amazing file launcher/object manipulation tool. Super duper easy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mozilla.com/&quot;&gt;Firefox&lt;/a&gt; is an alternate web browser that many people like.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.caminobrowser.org/&quot;&gt;Camino&lt;/a&gt; is my preferred web browser for business type stuff.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.titanium.free.fr/pgs/english.html&quot;&gt;OnyX&lt;/a&gt; is a great program for tweaking stuff in OS X, including dock position, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.adiumx.com/&quot;&gt;Adium&lt;/a&gt; is an excellent multi-protocol chat program; it really covers all the bases.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.skype.com/&quot;&gt;Skype&lt;/a&gt; is great for voice and video chat; I use this with my fam and friends.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://joost.com/&quot;&gt;Joost&lt;/a&gt; is still invite-only, but you can sign up to get on the beta list. Joost is an online television set type thingy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.newsgator.com/download/products/NetNewsWireLite2.1.1.dmg.zip&quot;&gt;NetNewsWire Lite&lt;/a&gt; is an excellent news reader application! Make sure and subscribe to &lt;a href=&quot;http://jonmagic.com/feed/atom.xml&quot;&gt;my feed&lt;/a&gt; once you install it üòÉ&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was thinking I used a lot more programs, but with web-based applications really starting to be just as functional as desktop apps, I don‚Äôt use nearly as many desktop apps as I used to. Here are some web apps I use all the time:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://gmail.com/&quot;&gt;Gmail&lt;/a&gt; is a free email solution, by far the best in my opinion.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://docs.google.com/&quot;&gt;Google Docs and Spreadsheets&lt;/a&gt; has completely replaced Microsoft Office for my needs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://calendar.google.com/&quot;&gt;Google Calendar&lt;/a&gt; is a flexible calendar with great sharing capabilities. I also use &lt;a href=&quot;http://chip.cuccio.us/projects/gcal/&quot;&gt;Gcal&lt;/a&gt; as a standalone desktop interface to Gcal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://del.icio.us/&quot;&gt;Del.icio.us&lt;/a&gt; handles all my bookmarks. I make sure and go to their help section and drag both the ‚Äúpost to &lt;a href=&quot;http://del.icio.us/&quot;&gt;del.icio.us&lt;/a&gt;‚Äù and ‚Äúmy &lt;a href=&quot;http://del.icio.us/&quot;&gt;del.icio.us&lt;/a&gt;‚Äù bookmarklets onto my bookmarks bar in all my browsers. In Safari, if you make them the first two bookmarks on your bookmarks bar, you can access them with &lt;code&gt;CMD-1&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;CMD-2&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://flickr.com/&quot;&gt;Flickr&lt;/a&gt; is where I store all my digital photos online. I guess I mostly just use iPhoto on my laptop though, and then upload to Flickr for backup.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I have reluctantly started using &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.facebook.com/&quot;&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; to keep in contact with people, and their Pictures section is also really handy for getting photos to friends and family.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 8:&lt;/strong&gt;
Go to the folder you downloaded all these great programs to and start double clicking those installer icons üòÉ Some you will expand to a new folder, and then you can drag the app over to your Applications folder on your dock (if you followed step 4). Other installers will actually run a full fledged install app that will copy things to the appropriate places automatically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 9:&lt;/strong&gt;
Go to your Applications folder and look for Quicksilver, which you copied there in the previous step‚Ä¶ Double click it and follow the setup instructions. I always re-assign my hotkey to &lt;code&gt;CMD-Space&lt;/code&gt; for ease of use. Once Quicksilver is loaded, press &lt;code&gt;CMD-Space&lt;/code&gt; to open it, then press &lt;code&gt;CMD-,&lt;/code&gt; to open Quicksilver Preferences. I set mine to start at login and sometimes tweak some other settings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 10:&lt;/strong&gt;
I like to open up OnyX and set my dock to the right-hand side and so that it aligns to the bottom; that‚Äôs just me though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a good start. I‚Äôll add to it as I think of more things üòÉ&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Wow, in preparation for our open house this weekend we have been on a mad spree: remodeling the office, making line cards, new business cards, gift certificates, new tables and chairs, &lt;strong&gt;AND&lt;/strong&gt; a &lt;a href=&quot;http://sabretechllc.com/&quot;&gt;NEW WEBSiTE&lt;/a&gt;!!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://mintchaos.com/&quot;&gt;Christian Metts&lt;/a&gt; took some ideas I had and a bunch of good ideas he had and threw together a layout with images in Photoshop in just a few hours. He sent me 4 images: a header, navbar background, navbar divider, a couple hex codes, and an image with the overall look and feel he wanted‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I took everything he sent and threw it together into a fairly comparable real page using HTML, CSS, and images, all on top of &lt;a href=&quot;http://mephistoblog.com/&quot;&gt;mephisto&lt;/a&gt;. It took me about 4 hours, and then another 30 min of Christian showing me how to tweak stuff, and I have a gorgeous site that works in 6 browsers (that‚Äôs how many I‚Äôve tested so far). Check out the &lt;a href=&quot;http://jonmagic.com/assets/2007/7/13/before.png&quot;&gt;before&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://jonmagic.com/assets/2007/7/13/mockup.png&quot;&gt;mockup&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://sabretechllc.com/&quot;&gt;after&lt;/a&gt; pictures‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>ATT is not my friend</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;When we bought SabreTech, Brad and I had our phone service changed and found out a nice little policy of ATT (SBC at the time)‚Ä¶ We were paying for a static IP address, which means our internet address won‚Äôt change on a day to day, year to year basis‚Ä¶ But it turns out, if you make any kind of change to your account, dsl or regular phone stuff, they assign you a new set of IPs‚Ä¶ This is a major pain for a company like ours, so we‚Äôve avoided making changes to our account since then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until last month that is, when we had to have some of our phone stuff fixed because ATT screwed it up (won‚Äôt go into details)‚Ä¶ Anyways, when we called to have this stuff fixed, we were assured our IPs wouldn‚Äôt change‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Welcome Today, guess what I find when I get into work this morning‚Ä¶ Our internet is down, and I have a sneaking suspicion it is because they changed our IPs‚Ä¶ I call ATT dsl tech support, and after they tested the line I suggested they check what IP range I was assigned and sure enough, they changed it‚Ä¶ I was irate, and for once that produced results (I never know which way to go with these things, play the nice guy, or play the frustrated client)‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, unlike last time, they were able to get us back up and running within 30 minutes (I had to stay on hold the entire time). This whole thing just burns me though, I‚Äôm tired of working with large corps that can‚Äôt tell their head from their tail, and unfortunately there are no other options around here‚Ä¶ So I guess you just have to pay the price, and lose several hours of your life a year for stupid stuff like this‚Ä¶ So if anyone ever tells you service x only costs y dollars from large corp z, make sure you figure in the time you‚Äôll have dealing with their stupidity‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>I&#39;m ready to teach... well, almost</title>
    <link href="https://jonmagic.com/posts/im-ready-to-teach-well-almost/"/>
    <updated>2007-01-20T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://jonmagic.com/posts/im-ready-to-teach-well-almost/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Two years ago while on vacation in Florida I had an epiphany, one of those moments where something just comes to you, and it feels so right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My epiphany was to take my consulting business and turn it into a chain, eventually a nationwide chain. There were several pieces to this dream, the first being starting some sort of school to train techs/tech managers, the second being giving them a financial platform to go out and start their own businesses under a larger nationwide corporate entity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thankfully I didn‚Äôt jump with this idea. The infamous GeekSquad started taking off about that time and we now see what a failed experiment that has been. But today my brain juices are flowing again and I‚Äôm getting that bug to do something bigger, bigger than what I‚Äôm doing right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now don‚Äôt get me wrong, I have absolutely nothing to complain about with my current situation. In those two years since my epiphany I‚Äôve partnered with Brad Cochran and bought a computer sales/service business (SabreTech), and then taken that business from a large debt to out of debt in 18 months (we were blessed to do it so quickly), and 2007 promises to be an absolutely amazing year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok, so I was talking about them there brain juices. Learning from GeekSquad‚Äôs failure, I‚Äôm not so interested in doing the nationwide sales/service chain thing, but I am interested in the first part of my original epiphany, the tech/business school idea. I think this is an open wide market right now, and I don‚Äôt know of any school that is doing it right. There are the ITT tech schools, the 4 year schools with BS‚Äôs in computer science, and of course online tech schools. You can also just skip school and go take classes to get IT certifications, specializing in hardware/software/Microsoft/Linux/Web, just to name a few. But how valuable are these really? The people in the tech industry that I respect, that are really going somewhere, don‚Äôt seem to be recommending these sorts of education to anyone. So what does it take to become an IT industry leader, a professional with the skills needed to be a great, not good, but great IT consultant (I‚Äôm focusing on consultants because I‚Äôve always had a place in my heart for small to medium businesses that can‚Äôt afford a dedicated IT person, so they outsource)‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This list will be updated as I continue this thought, but here is a start:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Willing and eager to learn&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Able to be self taught&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Daring, but cautious at the same time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Calm, cool, and collected&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Efficient&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Good with people&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Question:&lt;/strong&gt; Can these qualities be taught?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of these things are specific to IT, in fact, a good tech doesn‚Äôt have to have tons of experience with computers if they have these skills. I‚Äôm not pulling these ideas out of the air. To be honest, from my personal experience, when I walk into a client‚Äôs business and am presented with the problem, over half the time I haven‚Äôt encountered the problem, and therefore do not know the solution.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Buffalo Technology, please redeem yourself</title>
    <link href="https://jonmagic.com/posts/buffalo-technology-please-redeem-yourself/"/>
    <updated>2007-01-19T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://jonmagic.com/posts/buffalo-technology-please-redeem-yourself/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve been eyeing the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.buffalo-technology.com/products/product-detail.php?productid=97&quot;&gt;Buffalo Terastation&lt;/a&gt; for awhile now, lots of storage in a nice little package. So when the opportunity to buy one came up, I jumped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of my clients needed a file storage / backup solution, and the Terastation seemed to fit the bill. I found it for a great price (1TB for 6 bills), punched in my credit card number, and 4 days later it was in my hands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I received the unit the middle of December, but we were so busy at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sabretechllc.com/&quot;&gt;SabreTech&lt;/a&gt; I scheduled the install for after the first of the year. I did go ahead and set the unit up, configured everything via the web interface, and tested it. I left in on the bench for 24 hours running, and then logged in and shut it down, everything seemed to be perfect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fast forward 3 weeks, when I go onsite and begin the setup for the client. After plugging it in it did its Star Trek like flashy light thing, then signaled that drives 2, 3, and 4 were either full or not working. I logged into the web interface, and it said those drives were not attached. So I shut it down and then started it back up; same thing. Rinse and repeat, again, the same result‚Ä¶ So I took it back to my office, started it up and called tech support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fast forward 30 minutes, on hold, finally I get to talk to tech support. They decide the controller must be the problem, as the likelihood of three drives going bad at the same time was slim to none. So they put me on hold and then forwarded me to the RMA department. The RMA department took my info and said they would email me instructions to do an advanced RMA (they ship me a new unit, I ship the old one back in the same box the new one came in, and they provide the shipping tag).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two hours later I got the email and forwarded it to Brad. He had problems getting the link to work, so I went ahead visited the link (no problem on my computer), and printed the form we needed to fill out and fax in. Brad filled in the form later that day, and the next day I took it somewhere to fax it (we can‚Äôt fax long-distance from our office). I faxed it, the fax machine printed out the receipt when it was done, and I forgot about it‚Ä¶ That was on Thursday the 11th of January.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fast forward to this Monday (the 15th) when Brad asked if I had heard anything from Buffalo on our RMA status. By this time we should have received either an email saying our new unit was on its way, or at least a confirmation that they had received our fax. I had nothing, so I called their tech support number again, waited on hold 45 minutes, finally got the tech, who forwarded to the RMA department, who proceeded to tell me they had not received my fax (great)‚Ä¶ So I drove somewhere to use a fax machine, faxed it twice (just to be sure), and then called Buffalo again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By this time I‚Äôm not really happy that I have to wait on hold twice each time I call to talk to someone in the RMA department, so after waiting 30 minutes on hold to get a tech, and then another 15 minutes on hold to get someone in RMA, I‚Äôm getting a bit hot under the collar. I asked the RMA person whether they had received my fax, they looked and said no. They asked what fax number I sent it to and then told me that was the fax number for the accounting department. After a little bit they figured out that advance RMA requests go to accounting due to the credit card info that is needed, and then it is forwarded to the RMA department. So they had me fax everything to a different number and confirmed that they received it, said they would fast track it and I should get an email within a day or two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This morning I asked Brad if he had heard from Buffalo, and no was the answer. So this afternoon I called AGAIN, waited on hold for 30 minutes and finally got a tech, who once AGAIN forwarded me to to the RMA department. The girl was very nice as I explained all that had transpired, and took care to read everything they had on their computers, and basically told me they had no idea why it hadn‚Äôt shipped out (they did say something about their inter-departmental computer systems taking 24-48 hours to update, what is that about?). Then they promised someone would call me by the end of the business day to let me know where things were at.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, the end of the business day has come and gone, and I will never buy Buffalo again, even if they fix this‚Ä¶ I know I titled the article with some sense of hope, but by the time I finished writing this, I realized I just don‚Äôt have the time to work with companies like this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Brad Cochran and I bought &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sabretechllc.com/&quot;&gt;SabreTech Consulting LLC&lt;/a&gt; just over a year and a half ago, and it is just about paid off‚Ä¶&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Good health the last 6 months (with the exception of today), I even had my wisdom teeth removed (finally!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I‚Äôve had the opportunity to travel, a lot&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://jonmagic.com/2006/5/16/i-bought-one&quot;&gt;New laptop&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New (used) car‚Ä¶ 98 Malibu&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Healthy family! My sis is back from school now too, and that is always nice‚Ä¶&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had other ones, but just can‚Äôt remember them all right now‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm sick and need to take a nap so I can get better, so I‚Äôm going to lie down now‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I started using &lt;a href=&quot;http://clearcheckbook.com/&quot;&gt;clearcheckbook.com&lt;/a&gt; about a month ago and have found it an excellent way to keep track of my spending and account balances.

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm hoping &lt;a href=&quot;http://pearbudget.com/&quot;&gt;pearbudget.com&lt;/a&gt; gets their act together soon and gives me a nice web20 app to do the budgeting part, but in the meantime I‚Äôll settle with my pencil and paper (sorry, just not a big Excel fan)‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;

    <id>https://jonmagic.com/posts/my-rig/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Not that anyone cares, but I thought I‚Äôd post my current computer setup, hardware and software‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Hardware&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm the kinda guy that enjoys the bleeding edge (first Mac was an 867mhz PB), so five days after Apple released the new &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apple.com/macbook/macbook.html&quot;&gt;Macbook&lt;/a&gt; I had my company order one for me. I got a stock &lt;a href=&quot;http://store.apple.com/1-800-MY-APPLE/WebObjects/AppleStore.woa/6344003/wo/pQ4GzSFdUzhy2yFxQOmq26OsQGg/2.?p=0&quot;&gt;black Macbook&lt;/a&gt; from Apple, and ordered 2GB of RAM and a 120GB SATA laptop drive from a third party retailer (can‚Äôt remember who)‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The day after the Macbook arrived my memory and harddrive showed up and I installed them. Needless to say, I will never own a Mac with less than 2GB of RAM after experiencing the difference between 512MB and 2GB.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This computer is fast, really really fast, and the 120GB of harddrive made it more than comfortable for having my entire music/photos/movies collection on my laptop, instead of just my desktop machine at home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apple.com/macbook/isight.html&quot;&gt;iSight&lt;/a&gt; camera is really nice too, although I haven‚Äôt really started using it for video conferencing yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love having the black Macbook, but I don‚Äôt have anything against the white ones, they are really slick too. The black one does tend to show any grease transferred from your hands, which could drive someone with &lt;strong&gt;OCD&lt;/strong&gt; nuts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Software&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well first off, I‚Äôm running &lt;strong&gt;OS X 10.4.8&lt;/strong&gt; now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition I bought &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.parallels.com/&quot;&gt;Parallels&lt;/a&gt; and I‚Äôm running &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/pro/default.mspx&quot;&gt;Windows XP Pro&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ubuntu.com/&quot;&gt;Ubuntu&lt;/a&gt;. I use &lt;a href=&quot;http://virtuedesktops.info/&quot;&gt;VirtueDesktops&lt;/a&gt; to keep everything clean and easily switch between my OS‚Äôs. It is really a thing of beauty and I love to show it off to my clients and of course other geeks (I had it all setup when I went to &lt;a href=&quot;http://railsconf.org/&quot;&gt;RailsConf&lt;/a&gt;, so that was fun, being that only a few people out of the 100+ people with Macbooks had the same setup).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I use &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apple.com/ilife/&quot;&gt;iTunes, iPhoto, iMovie, and iDVD&lt;/a&gt; quite regularly. I gave &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/mail/&quot;&gt;Apple Mail&lt;/a&gt; a spin but ended up back with the &lt;a href=&quot;http://gmail.com/&quot;&gt;Gmail&lt;/a&gt; web interface as my preferred mail client.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For coding I use &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.macromates.com/&quot;&gt;Textmate&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;IMHO&lt;/strong&gt; there is nothing better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to these I use &lt;a href=&quot;http://chip.cuccio.us/projects/gcal&quot;&gt;Gcal&lt;/a&gt; (a webkit based Google Calendar client), &lt;a href=&quot;http://mozilla.com/&quot;&gt;Firefox 1.5.0.7&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/safari/&quot;&gt;Safari&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stickies&quot;&gt;Stickies&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.newsgator.com/NGOLProduct.aspx?ProdId=NetNewsWire&amp;amp;ProdView=lite&quot;&gt;NetNewsWire Lite&lt;/a&gt;, Terminal, and a handful of other apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Problems/Issues&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôll finish this post off by mentioning some of the hardware issues I‚Äôve experienced with my Macbook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first was an inconvenient problem with the gloriously large trackpad. Due to its large size, and the poor (I hate to say poor, but how else can I describe it?) trackpad button design, the button would only work if I clicked within an inch of the center. This after two weeks of use. I found a nice little remedy (via Google) &lt;a href=&quot;http://ibloggedthis.com/2006/06/29/an-origami-solution-to-the-apple-macbook-trackpad-squishy-button-problem/&quot;&gt;using some origami&lt;/a&gt;, and it hasn‚Äôt been an issue since.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last and worst issue I can remember is when I got the &lt;a href=&quot;http://forums.macrumors.com/showthread.php?t=213531&quot;&gt;random macbook shutdown problem&lt;/a&gt;. Four weeks after I started using my Macbook it started shutting down whenever it felt like. Fortunately it seemed to do it more at night and not during work hours. But after a few days it was doing it all the time. I called Apple and started going through their annoying diagnostics: installing the factory RAM, installing the factory harddrive, reinstalling the OS, etc etc. Finally I got an &lt;strong&gt;RMA&lt;/strong&gt; and sent it in. &lt;strong&gt;BUT&lt;/strong&gt;, it took 16 days for them to get it back to me, which was extremely annoying, especially after being assured it would be back in 7 days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I really want to contribute somehow, but I‚Äôm a nobody in the web 2.0 world, and honestly haven‚Äôt had many groundbreaking ideas in a long time (if ever)‚Ä¶ But I will not be deterred, so I‚Äôve decided to start thinking about web 2.0 from an economic standpoint, since that was my focus in college‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, don‚Äôt come back here looking for amazing insights or anything. Maybe‚Äîjust maybe‚Äîthough, I‚Äôll have an epiphany and ‚Äúmake it‚Äù in the web 2.0 movement üòÉ&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Learning Rails</title>
    <link href="https://jonmagic.com/posts/learning-rails/"/>
    <updated>2006-09-30T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://jonmagic.com/posts/learning-rails/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Wow, what a couple of weeks (months) it has been‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My intro to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rubyonrails.com/&quot;&gt;rails&lt;/a&gt; began a few months ago when a &lt;a href=&quot;http://mintchaos.com/&quot;&gt;good friend and webdev guy&lt;/a&gt; told me he was using it heavily and suggested I check it out‚Ä¶ I have never had any real programming experience and while the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gzj723LkRJY&quot;&gt;rails intro video&lt;/a&gt; was cool I just couldn‚Äôt really get into it (scared, I think). SO, I stayed away for a little while, then came back and jumped on the bandwagon by adopting &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ManuInNZ/typo&quot;&gt;Typo&lt;/a&gt;, a nice little blogging app with a lot of functionality, all built on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rubyonrails.com/&quot;&gt;rails&lt;/a&gt;‚Ä¶ this saved me from having to learn how to program for a few more months and started to whet my appetite to learn more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, about 4 weeks ago someone (who shall remain nameless) looked me up and asked me to build a web app‚Ä¶ I could have shoved the project off on Joshaven, but he is already crazy busy, so I decided to commit. No more hiding in the shadows, no more chickening out because I don‚Äôt know how to program, no more excuses‚Ä¶ SO, I warned the client that I had no idea what I was doing and asked if he was still willing to pay me, and he was üòÉ so now I‚Äôm knee deep in this stuff and it‚Äôs only getting deeper‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After throwing together a pretty much non-functional demo, and convincing myself that I could do this, I decided I needed to read a book on programming in Ruby before I could really get comfortable in rails. So I ran on down to &lt;a href=&quot;https://poignant.guide/&quot;&gt;why‚Äôs poignant guide to ruby&lt;/a&gt; and finished it in a weekend. Since then life has been a lot easier, at least as far as programming goes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I jumped back into the project, started from scratch, and built a highly functional, even pretty, demo in 20 hours (two days)‚Ä¶ The client liked it and my friends and family even checked it out. That was Tuesday of last week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today is Sunday, although by the time I post this it will be Monday. I spent 3 days trying to get RMagick installed on my computer, finally succeeding late last night. Since then I‚Äôve revamped version 1 of the webapp to run faster, use better naming schemes, and have cleaner code all around (thanx for the input &lt;a href=&quot;http://mintchaos.com/&quot;&gt;xian&lt;/a&gt;, I took your advice on combining controllers).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that is my learning &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rubyonrails.com/&quot;&gt;rails&lt;/a&gt; experience. Five slow months of avoiding the inevitable and then four crazy &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rubyonrails.com/&quot;&gt;rubyonrails&lt;/a&gt; filled weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Good morning‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isn‚Äôt this great weather we‚Äôve been having! Temps have been in the 50‚Äôs and 60‚Äôs, thunderstorms have been rolling through‚Ä¶ I love a good storm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I‚Äôm wrapping up a big programming project, just doing the final touches here and there, addressing the customers final concerns, and I‚Äôve already started my next project. Sabretech is in dire need of a trouble ticket system better than the one we‚Äôre using‚Ä¶ We currently use the ticket system module in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.egroupware.org/&quot;&gt;egroupware&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the egroupware calendar module. I can say we are less than thrilled with our current situation‚Ä¶ So I‚Äôve started this new project and called it Optiks, short for Opportunity Tickets. As you can see, the first thing we‚Äôre dropping is the Trouble part üòÉ Dad suggested this, hehe‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm designing and building this with &lt;a href=&quot;http://37signals.com/&quot;&gt;37 Signals&lt;/a&gt; methodology in mind‚Ä¶ Some people would like it to have everything and the kitchen sink‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm mostly just interested in it doing a few simple things really well, with a nice API and the ability to expand and change it later on‚Ä¶ So that is what I‚Äôm doing!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, looks like I‚Äôll be jamming with Roll the Dice this coming Friday night‚Ä¶ I played in church this morning, and then practiced this afternoon with RtD‚Ä¶ We didn‚Äôt sound too bad i guess üòÉ&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good Night‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Hamachi all the way...</title>
    <link href="https://jonmagic.com/posts/hamachi-all-the-way/"/>
    <updated>2006-09-30T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://jonmagic.com/posts/hamachi-all-the-way/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Ok, I‚Äôve been following the development of Hamachi, a.k.a. way too darn easy &lt;strong&gt;VPN&lt;/strong&gt; for a couple months now‚Ä¶ Well I finally started using it today and I‚Äôve got to say‚Ä¶ &lt;strong&gt;WOW&lt;/strong&gt;, that was way too easy‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that‚Äôs the way we like it around here ‚Äî things so easy that you don‚Äôt have to even think about them, they just work‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wondering what the heck I‚Äôm talking about yet? Here‚Äôs the deal:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fact1 ‚Äì &lt;strong&gt;VPN&lt;/strong&gt; stands for Virtual Private Network.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fact2 ‚Äì What &lt;strong&gt;VPN&lt;/strong&gt; really means is, I can connect 2 or more computers together, no matter how far they are apart, and they‚Äôll think that they are sitting right next to each other and talk their little computer language to their hearts‚Äô content.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For example: I have a computer in Michigan and my friend has a computer in California and we want to share files with each other, share each other‚Äôs printer, share music, etc‚Ä¶ But how can we do this securely without anyone eavesdropping and stealing our stuff? With a &lt;strong&gt;VPN&lt;/strong&gt; of course‚Ä¶&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does it make sense yet?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fact3 ‚Äì &lt;strong&gt;VPN&lt;/strong&gt;‚Äôs have not been the easiest thing to configure for a number of years, and therefore were not used, or were used and cost a lot of money‚Ä¶&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fact4 ‚Äì Today that has changed‚Ä¶&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you go to &lt;a href=&quot;http://hamachi.cc/&quot;&gt;Hamachi‚Äôs Website&lt;/a&gt; you can download Hamachi for Windows or Linux and install it and use it inside of 2 minutes. If you use an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apple.com/&quot;&gt;Apple Computer&lt;/a&gt; running &lt;strong&gt;OSX&lt;/strong&gt; then you‚Äôll want to head over to this forum and check it out, or just continue reading as I‚Äôm going to give my own little How-To‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First, go to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www-user.rhrk.uni-kl.de/~nissler/tuntap/&quot;&gt;This Website&lt;/a&gt; and download the tuntap that is appropriate for your version of &lt;strong&gt;OSX&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Second, once that file is downloaded open a Terminal session and browse to &lt;code&gt;~/Desktop&lt;/code&gt; (or wherever you just downloaded that file to).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Type:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-sh&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-sh&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;tar&lt;/span&gt; zxvf tuntap*.tar.gz&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Now go to Finder and double click the ‚Äútuntap_installer.pkg‚Äù icon and follow the directions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go to &lt;a href=&quot;http://files.hamachi.cc/osx&quot;&gt;This Website&lt;/a&gt; and download the latest version of Hamachi for &lt;strong&gt;OSX&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open the Terminal again and browse to wherever you downloaded the hamachi file to.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Type:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-sh&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-sh&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;tar&lt;/span&gt; zxvf hamachi-0.9.9.9-12-osx.tar.gz&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Now in your terminal type:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;language-sh&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-sh&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;sudo&lt;/span&gt; tuncfg&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In Finder, find the hamachi file you just expanded, look in the new folder that was created.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open the &lt;strong&gt;README&lt;/strong&gt; and follow the directions from there and you‚Äôll be up and running in no time üòÉ&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>flock, the good and the bad</title>
    <link href="https://jonmagic.com/posts/flock-the-good-and-the-bad/"/>
    <updated>2006-09-30T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://jonmagic.com/posts/flock-the-good-and-the-bad/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Well, I‚Äôve got mixed feelings about &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flock.com/&quot;&gt;flock&lt;/a&gt; right now. Despite the negatives I‚Äôm about to list, you should definitely try it out if you can‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Positives:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It just seems snappier on my 867mhz PowerBook than Firefox. I wonder if they‚Äôve optimized it at all? Firefox‚Äôs speed has been the one thing that kept me from switching all my web browsing from Safari to Firefox, so maybe Flock will do the trick?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It looks cool, clean low profile interface, no big ugly extras.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It has great features: blog posting, &lt;a href=&quot;http://del.icio.us/&quot;&gt;del.icio.us&lt;/a&gt; favorites, &lt;a href=&quot;http://flickr.com/&quot;&gt;flickr&lt;/a&gt; bar, and it is based on Firefox, so who knows what extensions and themes will come out‚Ä¶&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Negatives:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Limited blog support, won‚Äôt work with my typo blog &lt;strong&gt;UPDATE&lt;/strong&gt; I got it working, just had to click ‚ÄúCancel‚Äù after it fails to auto detect your blog, and then it lets you setup stuff manually‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm posting this update via Flock.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Creating a new favorite with tags does not tag it in &lt;a href=&quot;http://del.icio.us/&quot;&gt;del.icio.us&lt;/a&gt; (this has to be a bug that they haven‚Äôt fixed yet).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There was way too much hype surrounding Flock. Thankfully I ignored most of it, so I‚Äôm not disappointed too much, but it still doesn‚Äôt quite live up to what I thought it would be‚Ä¶ Thank goodness this is only a dev release I‚Äôm using üòÉ&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/strong&gt;
I think this is going to be a great browser, and there is a pretty good chance I will use it as my primary (hopefully only) web browser once it is a little more mature‚Ä¶ actually, I‚Äôll use it as my primary now, at least for a few days, and see if I can find any other nuggets hidden in there‚Ä¶ nuf said.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;My head hurts‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I should be going to sleep right now, but I‚Äôm having such a hard time letting go‚Ä¶ this has been a crazy week of late nights programming, long days at work, and crappy weather‚Ä¶ but it has been a good week. I‚Äôve learned a lot, spiritually and vocationally‚Ä¶ I worked 12 hours today and accomplished a lot, even had lunch with a good friend and mentor. My coworker, Josh, and I have been getting along extremely well, which is exciting in and of itself. He had a pretty killer week but stayed on top of things and didn‚Äôt lose it (which is good, because I‚Äôve been worrying about him)‚Ä¶ So all in all, I‚Äôm pretty excited to be going into tomorrow‚ÄîFriday, the last day of the week. I‚Äôll be out of state from tomorrow morning until Saturday evening (weird, I‚Äôll be 24 then).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another year gone past, the best year in a lot of years if you think about it‚Ä¶ new beginnings, painful endings, learning, appreciating, worshipping, crying, calling, moving, working, wondering, loving, living, dying.&lt;/p&gt;

    <id>https://jonmagic.com/posts/time-for-change/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve been meaning to redo my site for quite some time now‚Ä¶ &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.blosxom.com/&quot;&gt;blosxom&lt;/a&gt; was great, but with time come changes. So I‚Äôve switched to using &lt;a href=&quot;http://typo.leetsoft.com/&quot;&gt;Typo&lt;/a&gt; for my blogging engine‚Ä¶ It was built using &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rubyonrails.com/&quot;&gt;RubyOnRails&lt;/a&gt;, a new web development framework that is pretty nifty‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What does this mean for you?&lt;/strong&gt; Not much really, a new look and feel‚Ä¶
My old site is still there with all the old content, just use the links on the right to access it‚Ä¶ I considered importing all my old posts to the new system, but decided I don‚Äôt have enough time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What does this mean for me?&lt;/strong&gt; Again, not much. It‚Äôs going to be easier to post now, and I can enhance my site using quite a bit more as I have time‚Ä¶ Any new feature I want I can implement, whether someone else has done it or not‚Ä¶ Hopefully this will get me excited about blogging again, so you my poor reader(s) do not get bored üòÉ&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don‚Äôt forget to change your newsreaders to point at the new &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/jonmagic&quot;&gt;xml feed&lt;/a&gt;‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;
